&lt;p&gt;Prompted by a comment on this youtube video I made of an Amiga 500 game project I was working on a couple years ago, I finally got around to writing up a little about how the scrolling worked. I really should&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging this at the time, instead of just tweeting about it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing, my bitplanes are interleaved by lines, so BPLxMOD is set to three-tile-widths plus three whole lines, since I&amp;rsquo;m using 4 bitplanes. Interleaving by lines lets me blit an entire tile in a single blitter op, instead of one for each bitplane. Saves a little bit of CPU time on each blit, basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this all runs in a big toroidal buffer (that is, a rectangular buffer that wraps horizontally and vertically. If you only scroll on one axis, that&amp;rsquo;s a circular buffer) that is sized to fit 23 tiles width and 19 tiles + 1 line height, so BPLxMOD are configured accordingly. The viewport is 20 tiles wide and 16 tiles high, cause it&amp;rsquo;s PAL 320x256. The buffer is logically a 22x18 tile &amp;ldquo;free scrolling&amp;rdquo; area, plus a 1 tile L-shaped edge for drawing new tiles into. By &amp;ldquo;free scrolling&amp;rdquo;, I mean: if you take center 20x16 tiles of the viewport as the starting position,  I can scroll up to 16 pixels in any direction—to show any part of the free scrolling area—just by setting BPLxPTx and BPLCONx appropriately at the start of my copperlist, and without needing to redraw any tiles. Because redrawing is slow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I start to scroll from that starting point, I then know if I&amp;rsquo;m scrolling up or down, and left or right, and I can prepare to draw new tiles into the offscreen L-shaped part of the buffer—whose actual position in memory of course depends on the BPLxPTx pointers and whether I am treating it as being top+left, top+right, bottom+left, or bottom+right—that are appropriate for the direction that I&amp;rsquo;ve started to scroll in. So that&amp;rsquo;s just blitter work; but because it&amp;rsquo;s offscreen, I wait until after VBLANK to start it, and it just runs while Denise is pushing pixels out to the monitor, and the CPU busy-waits for the blitter. This makes my blitting much slower, of course, since Denise&amp;rsquo;s memory reads take priority, but it&amp;rsquo;s fast enough: I still get the two tile strips drawn in about half a frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky bit in all of this is when the viewport overlaps the end of the buffer. If we only ever scroll vertically, it&amp;rsquo;s much simpler: on any given frame, we have N full scanlines in the buffer between the BPLxPTx address and the buffer&amp;rsquo;s end, so during vblank just set up the copper to wait until hblank of scanline N and then reset BPLxPTx to the start of the buffer. Denise then happily draws the remainder of the screen from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with horizontal scrolling as well, the end of the buffer ends up somewhere in the middle of a scanline, so now on any given frame we have N full scanlines, and one scanline with only M words in it (BPLCONx of course managing up to 16 pixels of horizontal scroll, so the contents of the buffer are always word-aligned—which is also necessary for blitting). It&amp;rsquo;s possible to have the copper wait until midway across the scanline before writing BPLxPTx, but this always left a glitch of a few pixels when I did that. It might be possible without the glitch, I dunno, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage it. So that&amp;rsquo;s where the 1 extra line in the buffer&amp;rsquo;s height comes in. It&amp;rsquo;s an overflow area, so that whenever the viewport would overlap the end of the buffer mid-scanline, I instead have this scanline filled with duplicate pixels so I can let the scanline finish then in hblank, set BPLxPTx to the top of the buffer + 1. Whenever I draw new tiles, I afterwards get the blitter to copy the whole scanline from the opposite edge of the buffer into this overflow area, so it&amp;rsquo;s ready and waiting when the viewport gets there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with all that, I get infinite horizontal and vertical smooth scrolling at a pretty high speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I mentioned I&amp;rsquo;ve got a 22x18 tile free scrolling area. You can get infinite scrolling with just one row and one column of extra tiles, so 21x17, but that means you can only scroll up to 8 pixels in any one direction before you absolutely must draw new tiles. That reduces the maximum scroll speed you can get, or (looking at it the other way around) means you need to draw new tiles more frequently. Since drawing tiles is pretty slow (especially when done while the screen is displaying), I can&amp;rsquo;t get much other work done on a frame where I have to redraw. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get this project to the point of adding sound—perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll pick it up again one day—but since audio must take priority over video (cause the glitches are much more irritating), I wanted to give myself breathing room so that I could happily defer tile redraws for a frame or maybe two if I needed to give priority to handling audio. And so the two rows and columns of extra tiles in the 22x18 free scrolling area gives me better scroll speed and much more timing flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>gamedev amiga</tag></post><post id="178082956032" url="https://backslashn.com/post/178082956032" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/178082956032/loud-rooms" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-09-14 18:44:19 GMT" date="Fri, 14 Sep 2018 19:44:19" unix-timestamp="1536950659" format="markdown" reblog-key="xvDP5x4D" slug="loud-rooms" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Loud Rooms</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Have I talked about loud rooms? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about loud rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First for those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t played Thief, sound is super significant in the game.  You can hear enemies, and enemies can hear you.  In Thief, sound travels: across rooms, around corners and through doors (though muffled).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making noise, whether by throwing objects, using explosives, or even just your clanking footsteps on a noisy surface will get you discovered.  As such, being aware of the sounds you&amp;rsquo;re making, and predicting the sounds you will make if you take certain paths or actions is a crucial skill for the player to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the sounds made by the player and NPCs, there&amp;rsquo;s ambient sounds too of course: water lapping, steam hissing, machinery clanking, and REALLY LOUD MACHINERY CLANKING.  That last one in particular makes it really hard for the player to hear enemy NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: although Thief models sounds being attenuated by distance, (with a sound&amp;rsquo;s path traced via a simplified spatial model), its model for AI&amp;rsquo;s hearing only takes each sound&amp;rsquo;s magnitude into account individually.  So an NPC hearing REALLY LOUD MACHINERY CLANKING (which naturally doesn&amp;rsquo;t signify anything to them) and simultaneously hearing the player&amp;rsquo;s footsteps tapping a little bit loud on a tile floor, can still hear those footsteps just as easily as if there was no other noise.  And so while it feels like a really loud noise going on should mask the player&amp;rsquo;s own noise a bit, that unfortunately just doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen.  Now the devs must have realised this sometime during or after Thief 1&amp;rsquo;s development, because in Thief 2 there&amp;rsquo;s a new feature to address it.  You can see where I&amp;rsquo;m going with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this feature didn&amp;rsquo;t end up actually being used in the shipping game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now everything from here comes from me reading the source code and (mis)understanding it, so there&amp;rsquo;s probably a few mistakes, but I think the gist is clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Thief 2 there&amp;rsquo;s a new property that can be added to room brushes, called &amp;ldquo;Loud Room&amp;rdquo;.  It seems clear to me from the name and its implementation that the intent was to have an approximation to sound-masking available to level designers, without making major AI changes.  Loud Room is a single float, presumably from 0.0 to 1.0.  The volume of sounds transmitted from this room to adjacent rooms are multiplied by this float.  This works in a similar way to how doors between rooms affects sound: each type of door has a similar float property that defines how much it blocks sound; and the volume of sounds is multiplied by (1.0 - blocking_factor) when a door is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the way I interpret Loud Room to have been intended to use, is to set it to, say, 0.6 on a room with the REALLY LOUD CLANKING MACHINERY, which probably has metal floors too just for laughs.  Then the player&amp;rsquo;s noisy footsteps on the floor in that room would sound 40% quieter to NPCs outwith the room, making the player harder to audibly detect. Sound masking! …right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, sound goes both ways. Although the effect seems about right when the player&amp;rsquo;s in the loud room, it&amp;rsquo;ll seem entirely wrong if the player is outwith the room listening to an NPC walking on that metal floor inside it.  Because all the sound from the room is attenuated, the player outwith the room will hear the NPC&amp;rsquo;s footsteps as 40% quieter, and the REALLY LOUD MACHINE CLANKS will be 40% quieter too.  Which would be just weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that no doubt explains why they didn&amp;rsquo;t use this feature in shipping levels: I&amp;rsquo;m guessing they came up with this simple system (in terms of implementation: it&amp;rsquo;s not much more than two lines of code), tried it out, then cut it when it didn&amp;rsquo;t work right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in all the levels that shipped with Thief 2, it turns out that there is actually a single room with this Loud Room property set on it. In the mission Framed, in the basement of the City Watch headquarters, is a &amp;ldquo;machinery room&amp;rdquo;. And it has the Loud Room property on it!  Which seems appropriate, since it is full of machinery. Though fairly quiet machinery as these things go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the Loud Room value set on it is 1.0, which means the property isn&amp;rsquo;t causing any attenuation of sounds anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apart from that, this room is basically a dead end at the end of a hallway in the basement: there&amp;rsquo;s never any NPCs just outside it to listen; there&amp;rsquo;s no noisy floor surfaces in the room (it&amp;rsquo;s all stone); so it&amp;rsquo;s not even a situation where Loud Room would make much difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There is an NPC who will walk to this room and hang around inside it. But there&amp;rsquo;s also no reason for the alternative interesting situation to arise either: where the player just outside the loud room makes noise that is masked for the NPC inside.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s the story of Loud Rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I just had to do the test. Turns out my reading of the code was missing one thing: the &amp;ldquo;loud room&amp;rdquo; attenuation factor is also applied to sounds originating within the loud room that the player is hearing in the loud room too!  I suppose that would let you walk clangily around in a loud room that had a hostile NPC in it, with the NPC&amp;rsquo;s hearing perception reduced accordingly.  But as a player it&amp;rsquo;s very weird to hear your footsteps in the room before, but then they suddenly get &lt;em&gt;quieter&lt;/em&gt; to you as you enter the loud room with the same floor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbUyhEKjk2Q" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first room with marble floors is a normal room, as a control.  The green room in the middle has no room brush so that sound cannot propagate through it, just to isolate.  The second room with metal floors is the loud room, with an attenuation factor of 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how my footsteps get audibly quieter as I enter the loud room.  Note also how the machinery in the loud room, despite having the same volume settings, actually sounds quieter than that in the control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the loud room property is actually applied to sounds that stay within the room, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the sounds in the room are quieter!  Doing this test shows that the &amp;ldquo;actually the sounds get quieter so the NPCs won&amp;rsquo;t hear them so well&amp;rdquo; approach to sound masking is pretty flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The doors at the end attenuate the sound with a factor of 0.2 by the way. I just needed to shut that infernal noise up!)&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>thief2</tag><tag>leveldesign</tag></post><post id="176561713367" url="https://backslashn.com/post/176561713367" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/176561713367/lighting-the-player-in-thief" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-08-02 19:06:09 GMT" date="Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:06:09" unix-timestamp="1533236769" format="markdown" reblog-key="PZKYNdfv" slug="lighting-the-player-in-thief" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Lighting the Player in Thief</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a couple people mentioning that Thief calculates how lit the player is by sampling the lightmap where the player is standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this sounded wrong to me. On numerous occasions I&amp;rsquo;ve been standing in what looks like a shadow, yet been lit much more brightly than the ground would indicate—like this &amp;ldquo;safe-ish&amp;rdquo; example from &lt;a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2012/07/thief-1s-assassins-and-environmental.html"&gt;Robert Yang&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/klOBKnp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fba14c7833cd2abf6eb8edc937e57986/tumblr_inline_pcx5mythUB1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The player is surprised to be quite visible in a shadowed area" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/klOBKnp.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thinking about the player moving through the Z axis: when climbing up a rope, for example, you can see the light gem change as you move in and out of view of lights around you. Sampling lightmaps doesn&amp;rsquo;t work here either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the player &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; stay grounded all the time, then sampling lightmaps is a pretty good way of determining visibility that is excellent for player feedback. But it seemed clear that Thief couldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing that—or not only that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, curious about how it actually calculates it, I dug into the Thief 2 source code again. Obviously things may have changed between Thief 1 and 2, but it seems unlikely on the face of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for starters: the light gem code determines which of the light gem models to display by looking up player&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Visibility&amp;rdquo; property to get the light level. So it must have already been calculated earlier this frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="140" data-orig-width="473" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/XqGoaKi.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/038baf5bca64fb0f927680719e5f05a5/tumblr_inline_pcx5myHXp41qzlvtz_540.png" alt="Visibility calculated by calling `AIGetVisibility(PlayerObject())`" data-orig-height="140" data-orig-width="473" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/XqGoaKi.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the trail of breadcrumbs through the game, eventually I find the light level (ignoring other visibility modifiers like crouching, holding a weapon, moving and so on) being calculated by &lt;code&gt;compute_object_lighting()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="418" data-orig-width="435" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/OhiYHuU.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe6e3b5ff11db4e63fc4eb37aa15107e/tumblr_inline_pcx5mzqZ8n1qzlvtz_540.png" alt="Frame update code that calls `AIUpdateVisibility()`" data-orig-height="418" data-orig-width="435" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/OhiYHuU.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="383" data-orig-width="630" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/ae0nC0x.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/5bc389d9075a0f8ba3dd2ff3e4ad1482/tumblr_inline_pcx5n0JryR1qzlvtz_540.png" alt="`AIUpdateVisibility()` function calls `CalculateLightRating()`" data-orig-height="383" data-orig-width="630" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/ae0nC0x.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="319" data-orig-width="696" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/N8zHb0P.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc052db8909e0ee5f6bff4d04c98654b/tumblr_inline_pcx5n087oM1qzlvtz_540.png" alt="`CalculateLightRating()` function calls `AIGetObjectLighting()`" data-orig-height="319" data-orig-width="696" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/N8zHb0P.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="118" data-orig-width="335" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/xGmc5rl.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/b095200291d983be233ab7bd991aedf1/tumblr_inline_pcx5n0WAnU1qzlvtz_540.png" alt="And `AIGetObjectLighting()` just defers to `compute_object_lighting()`" data-orig-height="118" data-orig-width="335" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/xGmc5rl.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;compute_object_lighting()&lt;/code&gt; seems fairly straightforward in principle: it just adds up the contributions from all the lights around. The bitfield and &lt;code&gt;inner_frac&lt;/code&gt; stuff is a bit confusing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="769" data-orig-width="590" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/0Biv32R.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/399c58a43b2805b5578adc965d65f6b7/tumblr_inline_pcx5n1VVpV1qzlvtz_540.png" alt="The code for `compute_object_lighting()`" data-orig-height="769" data-orig-width="590" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/0Biv32R.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging into &lt;code&gt;objGetShadows()&lt;/code&gt; makes it clearer: there&amp;rsquo;s a global cache with one entry for each object in the game, that keeps track of which BSP cell the object was last seen in, and a 96 bit field. Each bit there relates to one of the lights that touches that cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="592" data-orig-width="594" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Ls8JYX4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/d670019bba192d7e48a19d7d7f097a51/tumblr_inline_pcx5n1b5F31qzlvtz_540.png" alt="objGetShadows()` is looking up light indices from the current cell" data-orig-height="592" data-orig-width="594" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Ls8JYX4.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the static lighting is computed for the level (in the editor), each cell stores the indices of every static light in the map that reaches it. Cells can be quite large, so this could be a lot of static lights. No more than 96 though, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then for each object in that cell, this shadow cache bitfield has each bit corresponding to one of those lights: 1 if the object is visible to that light, and 0 if not. The &lt;code&gt;location_sees_light()&lt;/code&gt; call does raycasts to check if the object is visible to a light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="343" data-orig-width="572" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/M2ThRy5.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7456c17125a010d78742d3210e4da0b5/tumblr_inline_pcx5n1I55V1qzlvtz_540.png" alt="`location_sees_light()` raycasts through the BSP structure and then against objects" data-orig-height="343" data-orig-width="572" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/M2ThRy5.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since most objects don&amp;rsquo;t move much, the cache avoids having to do the expensive raycasts very often. Since a map in Thief 2 (pre-NewDark) could have at most 4096 objects total, this cache is 64kB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the conclusion of all that is: calculating the light falling on the player or any other object is done by iterating through the BSP cells&amp;rsquo; array of lights — &lt;code&gt;WR_CELL(cell)-&amp;amp;gt;light_indices&lt;/code&gt; — and doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch its lightmaps at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to save and reload. When I did: all my coffee, most of my medicine, my two spare tyres, and my full jerry cans had all gone! Confiscated or destroyed by random physics, I can&amp;rsquo;t say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to replace it all. I guess I just try to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I can wash all the mud off the car. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not &lt;em&gt;on fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/3zDxtPt.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/339ac1d2978038646add1c767d6cd0eb/tumblr_inline_pabhlpUiQI1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Flame decals streak across the bonnet and from the wheel wells of my car.

&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough money to pay for the motel! So I sold the spare tyres I snagged off an abandoned car, which left me enough for the night. Also bought a couple tyre repair kits: probably going to need them now I don&amp;rsquo;t have any spares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop: Dresden!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not two minutes later: bang! flubble flubble flubble flubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, another flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:16 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four!? Four boxes that fell off the back of a truck? The game&amp;rsquo;s being super generous now I&amp;rsquo;m almost broke! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/JmT8tAA.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce862413d2c61567923a1da87e632701/tumblr_inline_pabhlqI22d1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="My car is parked on the side of a dirt road. Four boxes sit by the side of the road, just waiting for me to take them." data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/JmT8tAA.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of them were full of wine (which sells for a lot!), one of tobacco (eh, okay), and the other I didn&amp;rsquo;t open, just put it on my roof rack. It&amp;rsquo;s a mystery for later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just hope I find a shop soon—or I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to take alcohol across the border into Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fate is smiling on me now. A little further on, I found three more boxes by the railway tracks: one full of wine, one jam packed full of cigarettes, and the third with a few packs of coffee. I had to leave the coffee behind: no more room in the car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at all this contraband!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/9hJgpaz.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/1072ab9442f73a185d9ce13651459fba/tumblr_inline_pabhlqW6mq1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The car's boot and roof rack is packed with wine, cigarettes, and medicine." data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/9hJgpaz.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:29 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossed the train tracks and another tire blew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m out of repair kits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m driving on a flat for the next 250km &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I don&amp;rsquo;t think this game simulates ruining your rims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:35 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;beautiful!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/6EgkFHx.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb132d0ddd8ca3e5096334bdbaca4cb0/tumblr_inline_pabhlrNv8J1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="It's a garage.

You can&amp;rsquo;t be out. Not &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; out, surely? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/LlyTqtl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8c6e8d7087eef5cf70d3bf3879bb889/tumblr_inline_pabhlrMYcB1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The cashier says: 'I'm sorry, I'm out of cash.'" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/LlyTqtl.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:58 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after buying four new tyres, an engine repair kit, two tyre repair kits, a bottle of oil, a full tank of fuel, and a full jerry can of fuel, I was able to sell all the rest of my textiles, wine and medicine—and make a tidy profit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/OVkGefT.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/b52382d770f5386a9861cb9f5f787517/tumblr_inline_pabhlr8Gkv1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A ridiculous pile of wine, textiles, cigarettes, and medicine on the counter in the shop." data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/OVkGefT.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:00 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 206 miles to Berlin. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a full tank of gas, two dozen cartons of cigarettes, it&amp;rsquo;s dark, and I&amp;rsquo;m wearing sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/ghGUQB4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d27f559d5031b82322a0644ae97941b/tumblr_inline_pabhlsz9bQ1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The beast is all ready to go, with four brand spanking new wheels and a clean wash.

But it feels good anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:20 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sold all of my cigarettes. There were quite a lot! Total cash now: a nice round $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/D8oNZ5n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/14036e011782036ae9dab70083297824/tumblr_inline_pabhlsiUaK1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A pile of cigarette cartons.

&lt;p&gt;Here I am, back where I began, on the outskirts of Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve days later. Five hundred dollars better off. Five thousand, nine hundred, and forty-four kilometres travelled. Almost every part of the car has been replaced and upgraded twice over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for a good night&amp;rsquo;s rest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/rTITzxZ.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/234384bc48f0569428a75daa90db2018/tumblr_inline_pabhltuhIw1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="My Laika is parked in the old familiar junkyard.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rather a bit clunky. It won&amp;rsquo;t win any awards for looks. It breaks down more often than I&amp;rsquo;d prefer. But I love it, and I really enjoyed my time with it.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>jalopy</tag></post><post id="174879529332" url="https://backslashn.com/post/174879529332" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/174879529332/jalopy-part-3" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-06-14 09:54:33 GMT" date="Thu, 14 Jun 2018 10:54:33" unix-timestamp="1528970073" format="markdown" reblog-key="lKWEecaD" slug="jalopy-part-3" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Jalopy, Part 3</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continued from &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174879503372/jalopy-part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:44 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found an abandoned car on the side of the road, so just casually swapped engines with it, as you do, because its was a little more powerful. Needs maintenance though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Zw13epd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/97d95f512dee2946cd4da86903234f44/tumblr_inline_pabhluSPzy1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The shell of a car on the left.

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful sunrise as I depart Malko Tornova, heading through the mountains towards Dubrovnik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/rp6wsPM.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fdb9bb2409edd06572082e2bf071a87e/tumblr_inline_pabhlvLC1i1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Beyond the scratched and stone-shattered windscreen of my Laika, I can see the sun rising through a pine forest." data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/rp6wsPM.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jalopy is Oregon Trail, but in a ramshackle Trabant-alike through Eastern Europe, and instead of hunting and avoiding dysentery, you scavenge roadside junk and maintain your car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalopy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have highly-detailed reproductions of the countries you drive through of course! But it does have recognisable landmarks from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/zDVKjaC.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2805505d7876a95d18520945d11c21fb/tumblr_inline_pabhlviQ0b1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A concrete memorial is beside the road; a couple of cardboard boxes on the ground in front of it. In the distance on the hill is a UFO-shaped building with a high tower." data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/zDVKjaC.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:25 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalopy has a really good take on first-person inventory. As you walk around, you can carry up to three things in your hands. Often only need two: jerry can and an oil bottle; a spare tyre and a jack. You can cycle which is in your right hand to be used, and which two in the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much, much better than only being able to carry a single item in hand, like many similar games. And feels much more appropriate than having a huge inventory on your person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this limit is a nuisance when you&amp;rsquo;re buying or selling half a dozen or more small items at a shop: cigarettes, wine, coffee, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So every shop has baskets! You can stack items in a basket, and take them back out again. And you can sell a whole basketload at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrRqrTBp2u8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can put full baskets into the boot, or on the roofrack (if you bought one). It&amp;rsquo;s super neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFPdgBkRo3A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:49 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this instance I was buying coffee and medicine here because it was discounted. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to sell it for a modest profit in Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Bulgaria-Croatia border. Looks like medicine and coffee are allowed: only tobacco is proscribed at the moment. So thankfully I won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about being caught and fined (or worse!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/IqFnNUs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b13e8372d94dc968b2910e584d56d43/tumblr_inline_pabhlxcO7k1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A border post with an armed guard.

I guess I&amp;rsquo;m taking them further with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:11 AM - 13 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful morning by the ocean. A beautiful morning for getting a flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1067" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/JgPd2BM.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/42869bccb60f50e1a57578908291f8ed/tumblr_inline_pabhlx3aGj1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="My car is stopped on an ocean road.

&lt;p&gt;The way mud splashes on and builds up on your windows and windscreen is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkUTewh4ILg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir, are you all right? Do you need directions? The road&amp;rsquo;s this way, sir, not that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:45 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very cool bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1070" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/B9ueCW6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a5db5a89d9c53f3da6d6e211df86c0f/tumblr_inline_pabhlyz0Dg1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A bridge.

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s this? Oh, just a box of sausages I found on the side of the road. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;re good and edible. I&amp;rsquo;ll just sell them at the next shop I come to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1070" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/BxguAns.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/16a5fff0e379a87f78ad2a83d8d6e6c1/tumblr_inline_pabhlyQHfl1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="An open box full of sausage packages is next to the car.

There was a second box with a bunch of—&amp;quot;textiles&amp;quot; it called them, but it looks like yarn to me—which I&amp;rsquo;ve stacked up on the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1070" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/UfatzuD.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/360aaa680a5fe135e8c77ad6d01a0228/tumblr_inline_pabhlypdv11qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The open boot of the car now has a neat pile of sausages and a neat pile of yarn." data-orig-height="1070" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/UfatzuD.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:58 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh damn, looks like we&amp;rsquo;ve got a flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1070" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/idKsS4U.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3f7ccfe6d374e1a4e5b98896777073c/tumblr_inline_pabhlz1xyg1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The right rear tire of the car is flat.

Jack up the car. Loosen the wheel nuts. Take off the wheel. Patch it up. Put the wheel back on. Tighten up the nuts. Lower the jack. Pick it up and put it back in the boot. And on we go again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very relaxing to play, even as my car falls apart under me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that interacting with objects in games is so much fun? It was such a big thing in the 90s—from Ultima VII to Duke Nukem 3D—yet all but forgotten by big games these days. Thankfully indies are picking up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fun&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t quite the right word there. Satisfying. Interacting with objects is very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was why Receiver was enjoyable to play. It&amp;rsquo;s why Gone Home was enjoyable. And it&amp;rsquo;s a big part of Jalopy&amp;rsquo;s attraction too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:24 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone driving on the left side of the road? Must be a British tourist. Those locals aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be very happy with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filling up the car and the jerry can. Mustn&amp;rsquo;t forget the oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nsd7oOvmVo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bought some new tires, so let&amp;rsquo;s change out the old worn out ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gu92w-0NtCY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:57 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran out of fuel again. But no worries, I have a full jerrycan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only it&amp;rsquo;s not letting me fill the car. This is an unfortunate bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save and quit, and then I can continue. But it&amp;rsquo;s restarted me back at the motel at the start of the day. Eeh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:30 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refueling bug happened again. This time I&amp;rsquo;d only just left the motel in Dubrovnik, so not really having to retrace ground at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the newspapers, you can find out which goods are in demand in the next country, or which are banned. There&amp;rsquo;s the opportunity to make a little money by trading accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet tried carrying banned goods across the border though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:28 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Malko Tornova, Bulgaria, about to cross the border into Turkey. But the battery&amp;rsquo;s flat, so the car won&amp;rsquo;t start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And seems there&amp;rsquo;s no way to charge it, nor does the shop here sell new batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the end, it&amp;rsquo;s a rather ignominious one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, the petrol station doesn&amp;rsquo;t sell batteries, but the Laika dealer does. Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:02 PM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made it to Istanbul. 2500+km and 6 days after setting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the next thing to do would be to drive all the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continued in &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174879529332/jalopy-part-3"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>jalopy</tag></post><post id="174879485397" url="https://backslashn.com/post/174879485397" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/174879485397/jalopy-part-1" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-06-14 09:51:16 GMT" date="Thu, 14 Jun 2018 10:51:16" unix-timestamp="1528969876" format="markdown" reblog-key="7E8ju0OA" slug="jalopy-part-1" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Jalopy, Part 1</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:56 AM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Available to buy from &lt;a href="https://www.gog.com/game/jalopy"&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/jalopy"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/446020/Jalopy/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;rsquo;t let me put oil into the engine :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do like how my character can just walk around casually carrying the engine block though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car is a beast! 0 to 60 in just 22.5 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are wisps of smoking coming from the bonnet. Should I be worried?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the night at the motel, but now it won&amp;rsquo;t let me start the car? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t say why at all, just beeps at me when I try to :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the steam forums to try to find out what I&amp;rsquo;m missing, and wow are there a ton of threads about bugs &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to select a route on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bigger problem: for some reason, although I filled up the petrol tank and the jerry can, we ran out of fuel in minutes, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the jerry can is now empty?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also somehow it&amp;rsquo;s night again already? The day lasted like five minutes??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:48 AM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back to the petrol station—which is on the other side of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guards don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind me crossing the border on foot though, they just ignore me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, I forgot the jerry can and my wallet. Back across the border to the car, then all the way back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, got some fuel. Made it back to the car, filled it up. Went to add oil to the mix, but whoops: out of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess we&amp;rsquo;re driving on straight petrol then! Hope the bearings don&amp;rsquo;t seize up &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:04 AM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found a cardboard box full of medicine just sitting in the middle of a mountain road. How strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking it with me, cause that stuff&amp;rsquo;s valuable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car&amp;rsquo;s rather a mess after driving on these muddy roads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1076" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/76vHW6V.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a1dd1361832b2c169f671b3851e9e4e/tumblr_inline_pabhm0KHFz1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Mud is splattered all over the bumper and sides of my Laika." data-orig-height="1076" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/76vHW6V.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh, yeah. Don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to drive across there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1076" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/DkZ67d7.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/53d95b7bdc7314df81986aad020866a5/tumblr_inline_pabhm1QZHC1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A wooden bridge over a river.

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:29 AM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran out of fuel again, right on the train tracks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1076" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/SQ6dF7y.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/76fd76d62aeafa58ddb01b4079969703/tumblr_inline_pabhm1dpgi1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="It's night, and the muddy car is stopped on the train tracks. An engine can be seen away down the tracks in the distance." data-orig-height="1076" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/SQ6dF7y.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jerry can was full this time, so at least we&amp;rsquo;re not stuck here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:49 AM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; got to the town, and realised I&amp;rsquo;d bought some stuff way back at the petrol station just by the railway bridge, but had forgotten to collect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than drive the car all the way back, wearing it down, and consuming fuel and stuff, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just walk back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take very much longer at all. Even though the distance is (according to the road signs) 210 km &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the days are short, but this night lasts forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time and space compression in this game is really weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, back at the car. Found a couple of boxes along the way too, so I had more medicine and wine to sell. Only had to walk 420km, totally worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:12 AM - 12 Jun 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. Spent the night in the motel at Sturovo. Now to cross the Hungarian border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, I&amp;rsquo;m going to bed: the 2 hours sleep I got last night is catching up to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway: Jalopy is cheap and cheerful. Even though the controls are fiddly, it&amp;rsquo;s not unpleasant to play. Drive around, collect things, buy things, maintain the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest complaint is just how fast the car eats through fuel and how fast all its parts degrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:38 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, about 60 hours into the game, I have come across a new Rite that has markedly different requirements. It looks like another potential ending, but not the true one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="337" data-orig-width="713" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/eF0LfHk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ca1fa980dd49ea24e2f252a96336561/tumblr_inline_p9yowmHYh41qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Rite Intercalate: This rite recapitulates the Sun's abominable fate. It is used in extreme times by foolish adepts." data-orig-height="337" data-orig-width="713" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/eF0LfHk.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which I guess means I now know how to get one poor ending and one I guess middling ending?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:41 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One source of my frustration in this game is the flavour text, some of which is significant and some of which is not. Which leads to confusion and disappointment when I think I&amp;rsquo;ve figured something out, only it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example, &lt;a href="https://rot13.com/"&gt;rot13&amp;rsquo;d&lt;/a&gt; for Peacock Door spoilers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is like the classic adventure game puzzle problem again, where you can&amp;rsquo;t use that crowbar you&amp;rsquo;re carrying to break that window (to get the mysterious chalice in the display), but can only use the rock found three screens away to break it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intentional red herrings aside, this is a difficult problem to identify as a designer, because you&amp;rsquo;re generally too close the problem itself. And you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about them from a different point of view: you already know the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a player has much more limited knowledge: they only know the facets of the problem they can see, and while they know the items they&amp;rsquo;re carrying, they bring a different set of preconceptions about the items with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while adventure game players have limited knowledge, but essentially unlimited imagination. They will come up with solution scenarios—that aren&amp;rsquo;t the puzzle&amp;rsquo;s solution—ranging from straightforward and eminently reasonable to creative and fantastical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;rsquo;ll have a good chain of reasoning that links it all together, and explains why their scenario &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they hit upon the designed solution in this manner—especially when creative and fantastical—that&amp;rsquo;s the eureka moment that the puzzles exist for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when they don't—and again, the more creative the solution, the bigger the effect here—they feel disappointed, frustrated, perhaps even angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the tightrope that all puzzle-based adventure games have to walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring it back to Cultist Simulator: the highly specific solutions to most problems, coupled with the plethora of cards and the &amp;ldquo;experiment to figure things out&amp;rdquo; ethos of not directly teaching the player much means it&amp;rsquo;s also walking this tightrope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I lost my balance and fell off a few times already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:09 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, where were we? Ah yes, waiting for this expedition to finish so I can send some minions to recruit some volunteer… uh, …prisoners. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait: not yet. Gonna finish the series of expeditions first, because I have the minions already. And anyway, the Red Hook is coming up next, and I won&amp;rsquo;t have time to get a prisoner for it before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:18 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random PS to the big train of thought earlier: the general obscurity in Cultist Simulator is definitely intentional. It&amp;rsquo;s both part of the roguelike tradition, and in this case meant to be suggestive of its fiction: studying arcane lore to understand occult mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it never really ends up feeling like that for me. I&amp;rsquo;m rarely piecing together clues (and when I am they are often false anyway). I&amp;rsquo;m not studying, slowly advancing in knowledge. I&amp;rsquo;m grinding: repeating a similar series of actions over and over to make numbers go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:26 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s two different expeditions in a row now that have only brought back spintriae. Are there no more books or tools to be found? Going to have to upgrade some secret histories lore so I&amp;rsquo;ve got some higher level locations to expeditionize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:34 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the most pointless card in Cultist Simulator? My shortlist, in no particular order, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streets Strange By Moonlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Consciousness of Radiance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fleeting Memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:10 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building up a nice little collection here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="139" data-orig-width="328" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/J2uZtun.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9d804580b52284ef64c8f34569a0866/tumblr_inline_p9yowmwa6Z1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Four 'Hapless Prisoner' cards." data-orig-height="139" data-orig-width="328" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/J2uZtun.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:19 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this thing where I turn my followers into prisoners, and then presumably eat them: I guess that makes them…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filet Minion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:42 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a reliable way of generating Dread when needed—that is, one without risk of generating Fascination instead. So Visions is no longer really a threat to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It used to be: Visions nearly killed me about 40 hours into the game. It was the closest I&amp;rsquo;ve come to death.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:47 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dungeon is becoming dangerously overcrowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="184" data-orig-width="658" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/8BLLo5P.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0125884a36693b9981b06d20ebab2bd9/tumblr_inline_p9yownVkYQ1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Seven cards, a mix of 'Hapless Prisoner' and 'A Follower Betrayed'." data-orig-height="184" data-orig-width="658" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/8BLLo5P.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Yes, this is probably overkill, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how many prisoners I need. So I&amp;rsquo;ll just keep farming them until I don&amp;rsquo;t need any more.)&lt;/p&gt;

But at long last I&amp;rsquo;ve got Red Hook coming up next, so I&amp;rsquo;ll find out if I need to keep feeding it prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:19 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: yes and no. It&amp;rsquo;s taken a prisoner, and kept me at the Sixth Mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will need to look elsewhere for the way to progress from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means more &amp;ldquo;use every inventory item with every other inventory item&amp;rdquo; fun! Yay! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually no: first it&amp;rsquo;s time for a savegame backup! I&amp;rsquo;m going to try the lesser endings here, to see how they play out. Then pick up again where I left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:28 PM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, whoops, I accidentally discovered the way to the Seventh Mark instead &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really noticed before that Cultist Simulator renamed the high quality graphics setting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, this Seventh Mark is just the same standard enlightenment ending again, but with one of the ordinary rites. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:59 AM - 7 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few final (probably) thoughts on Cultist Simulator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest design choices in Cultist Simulator is that everything with permanent destructive effects also has a renewable alternative. There are only one or two exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take followers, for example: there is a limited number of followers that you can recruit. After you hit that limit, attempts to recruit will always result in &amp;ldquo;a case of mistaken identity&amp;rdquo;. Followers have much needed skills and abilities, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the actions that you can get a follower to do—going on expeditions, looking for victims to abduct, going out to get money—come with moderate to high risk of the follower not coming back. Once you lose a follower, they&amp;rsquo;re gone for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of sending followers, you can recruit hirelings: it takes longer; costs money; no guarantee of getting a hireling you want (you have to commit the time to find them, but not the money if they don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills you want).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hirelings only hang around for two minutes if you don&amp;rsquo;t put them to work: but there&amp;rsquo;s always more hirelings, and time and money (once you get your economy bootstrapped) are unlimited in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why risk losing your followers permanently instead of sending a hireling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated than that, because there are followers with skills that hirelings don&amp;rsquo;t have. But except for expeditions, I never felt the lack of those skills: the risks I needed to take were taking prisoners, ambushing hunters, and destroying evidence. And hirelings have all the skills needed for those activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expeditions carry greater risk, and in the early game you basically have no choice except to risk followers on them. But as soon as you discover a little lore and summoning rites, you can send demons—another renewable resource—on expeditions instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me nicely to summoning: another case where there&amp;rsquo;s a permanent loss, except when there isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous rites for summoning: I&amp;rsquo;ve found nine. To the best of my ability to tell, they are all equivalent in what you can do with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you get out of a summoning (or passionreason conversion, or decrepitude decrementing) only depends on the Aspects you put in, and the strengths of those aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every rite needs Lore, and each needs two other things: an assistant/victim, or a tool, or an ingredient, or an Influence. Each rite consumes one specific type of the things that it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the early game, you may only have found one rite that, for example, needs and consumes an assistant. Which is a problem, because followers are limited, and hirelings may not have the Aspect you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly there is permanent loss if you use the rite that consumes Lore (you can get duplicates of Lore, but it&amp;rsquo;s very time-consuming and they&amp;rsquo;re also limited), or Tools (ditto).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then there&amp;rsquo;s two rites which consume Influence. And Influence cards are a fully renewable resource (you just have to dream past the appropriate Door to get them), and they expire in a minute if you don&amp;rsquo;t use them anyway! (Sometimes expiry has negative side effects too)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, once you find one of these two rites—and there&amp;rsquo;s duplicate copies of the rites to be found—you now have an infinite supply of demons at your call. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t have more than five at any one time, but they&amp;rsquo;re easily replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; weird case of the game seeming unwilling to risk permanent loss is when a summoning goes wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s quite rare for it to happen, but when it does you get a choice: cancel the summoning (no harm done, but you&amp;rsquo;ve lost your Influence card or whatever), or try to bring the demon under control again. If that fails, then the demon is loose, and grabs a card to consume it. Depending on the type of demon, it could grab a follower, or a Health card, or—well, those are the only two I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered. (Because while I&amp;rsquo;ve summoned literally dozens of demons during this one game, I&amp;rsquo;ve had about half a dozen failures, and only three actual escapes. I still have no idea what the odds of escape are, but it&amp;rsquo;s oddly low.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time a demon escaped, I was panicked: here it was, grabbing my follower, and devouring them (at least, the demon was labelled a &amp;ldquo;Devourer&amp;rdquo;). But then sixty seconds later, the demon vanished and there was my follower again, safe and sound. Like, what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same happened for Health: the demon grabbed one of my Health cards, chewed on it for a minute, then spat it back out (but dimmed, which takes another minute to refresh). I suppose if I only had the one Health this would be a risk, but I had three at the time, so no worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is getting way too long, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to sum it up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird in Cultist Simulator, a game about seeking occult enlightenment at all costs, that your risks go down as you progress in the game instead of escalating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:38 AM - 7 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending thoughts: one of my problems with the long featureless grind that this seventy-hour-long game of Cultist Simulator has become is that it&amp;rsquo;s directionless. I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for, let alone how to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I found one the lesser endings. The &amp;ldquo;standard Enlightenment&amp;rdquo; one, as the game calls it. But it&amp;rsquo;s evident there&amp;rsquo;s a true enlightment ending hiding away somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one of the things that Sunless Sea did much better was it started you off with an ending goal, an Ambition: finding your father&amp;rsquo;s bones, or retiring wealthy to a mansion, or making an incredible artwork. And there were Ambitions you could find as you went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Sunless Sea, the immediate requirements to complete every Ambition were clear, even if you had no idea how to go about them initially (such as it requiring an item that you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, given the variety of different Ambitions, if you found yourself unable or uninterested in pursuing one of them further, you could quite easily pick a different one to aim for instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in Cultist Simulator, the ending(s) are obscure, and how to find them is obscure, and how to achieve them is obscure. I only found a single hint at the ending I&amp;rsquo;ve done (in a Lore item I no longer have, so I can&amp;rsquo;t quote it here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Rite dialog also described &amp;ldquo;an ending&amp;rdquo; when I was experimenting with different cards in the slots, which lead to me discovering the requirements for that ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s not so much that it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to find &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; ending. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about it until late mid-game (I think it was). I was never working towards it. In fact, I was never really working towards &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that, more than anything else, is what makes the endless grind so tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:48 AM - 7 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m finished with the game now. Someone else will have to get the true ending. There are two curiosities which I think may relate to it, but who knows how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a book that I found ~60 hours in, &amp;ldquo;The Geminiad&amp;rdquo;. Unlike all the other books, this one took 90 seconds to study instead of 60. It yielded a new rite (Sea&amp;rsquo;s Marriage) and three Lore cards. And the book itself remained afterwards as a Tool (Knock 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is the Rite Intercalate. I was only able to get the same &amp;ldquo;standard Enlightment&amp;rdquo; ending with this that I could get with any of the other rites. But this one is quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most rites take three cards (consuming one) plus a Desire to get the ending, this rite takes five cards plus a Desire: one Lore, one Assistant, one Influence, one Tool, and one Ingredient. And it consumes them all permanently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so much different that I figure it&amp;rsquo;s got to be related to the true ending. But I&amp;rsquo;m well past caring now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is me officially done with Cultist Simulator. I don&amp;rsquo;t really regret buying it; I got about 10 hours of fun from it, but should have stopped then. I definitely sunk way too much time into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the state of my first and only game after 70 hours of grinding. If anyone wants the save file to try finding the true ending without doing that grind themselves, it&amp;rsquo;s here: &lt;a href="https://hastebin.com/diwibicika.txt"&gt;https://hastebin.com/diwibicika.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:31 PM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help me, I&amp;rsquo;m going back into it. I&amp;rsquo;m not expecting to enjoy it anymore. That fizzled out quite a while ago. I just want to see this damn thing finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:43 PM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting, perhaps helpful bug: on the rare occasion you get two good, timed cards in a stack (like two Erudition in this case), the timer on the bottom card doesn&amp;rsquo;t start until you break the stack or the top card has gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:12 PM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have six Erudition on the table right now. What are the odds I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get another two before they expire, so I can upgrade my Reason again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty low, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels a shame that they&amp;rsquo;ll all go to waste :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:22 PM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoof! There they go up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:34 PM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the fuck? I had the Fourth mark, and it&amp;rsquo;s gone and reverted back to the Third mark!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe did the detective prisoner work after all, only I didn&amp;rsquo;t register the difference in the Ascension card? And next time the red hook came around again it just downgraded me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:52 PM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My review of Cultist Simulator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="485" data-orig-width="440" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/fx1PpBj.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/40beabaacd570a8b678b64a34eb32e79/tumblr_inline_p9ytilEHYT1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A card with a symbol of a closed eye. The caption is 'Passion (Disillusioned)'." data-orig-height="485" data-orig-width="440" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/fx1PpBj.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:31 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the detective prisoner does work, and the problem is that I need to keep feeding this thing prisoners or I keep getting silently downgraded to Third Mark. What a shitty piece of grindy design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should have come into this game expecting a whole lot of grind, because both Fallen London and Sunless Sea had their fair share. And both kinda left me to figure out how to progress on my own too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the context was different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallen London I played on my phone in short snippets of otherwise dead time. It filled up minutes here and minutes there, and so I was never at the grindstone for very long. As for progress: well I eventually stopped playing when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to progress any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Sunless Sea the grind was actually pleasant and engaging: sailing around, navigating around coastlines and between buoys to slow the rise of Terror, carefully keeping my distance from sea monsters—or attacking them if I felt strong enough. Much more than watching timers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And progression in Sunless Sea was much better balanced: not only were there always dozens of islands you could go to explore, but I could see—inherently from the fog of war on the map—the places I had yet to explore. So instead of being stuck unable to figure out how to get any further, I only had to look at the map and pick a fogged area to visit next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These may seem like small differences, but they make a huge impact on my experience of the grind and ability to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:49 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um okay. So this Health upgrade—Steely Physique plus eight Vitality—just finished, and out the other dropped out Steely Physique again (of course), and a new Health (yay), but also all eight Vitality too &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess… I guess I&amp;rsquo;m upgrading my health again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vital statistics looking healthy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="90" data-orig-width="673" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/fsgo0Kg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d1588945c832a45d9f62916890d2d98/tumblr_inline_p9ytil8vOH1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Health: 8. Passion: 10. Reason: 10. Funds: 45." data-orig-height="90" data-orig-width="673" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/fsgo0Kg.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:48 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the big question is: if I feed the red hook thing two prisoners in a row, will that get me to the Fifth Mark? And if so, will it just degrade again, or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been even able to get two prisoners in a row yet :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m very slowly collecting Forgotten Chronicles and the rare Forbidden Epic from the Stag Door, and even more slowly collecting Unresolved Ambiguities and the rare next one from the Peacock&amp;rsquo;s Door (stupid things need repairing each time) with the goal being to keep exploring level 14 locations until they run out. And occasionally exploring lower-level locations, because they&amp;rsquo;re still drip-feeding me a few books and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m running pretty low on Spintriae though—except for the Iron ones, they just pile up cause I have no use for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d sell them at the auction house, except my Explore oven is always busy with expeditions, or with getting locations from Secret Histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:57 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa! This book I just read must be special: it took 90 seconds instead of the usual 60, and has served up five cards!! I&amp;rsquo;m almost afraid to turn them over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Lore, one Tool, and a hitherto unknown Rite. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:23 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridiculous gameplay when you end up summoning a demon just to avoid an Influence decaying into Dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:27 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still trying to get prisoners. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy at all. Basically I have to wait until a Hunter appears (many, many minutes apart), then send a demon after them, and hope that instead of killing them, the demon merely captures them (quite rare).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that, how the hell am I supposed to get hold of two prisoners in a row for the red hook?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, forget two in a row! Just checked the forums and apparently &lt;em&gt;all four&lt;/em&gt; of the next marks need prisoners, and just degrade again without them? What the actual fuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:30 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remembered there&amp;rsquo;s a way to turn my followers into prisoners, which I guess is probably reliable—but definitely not dependable, cause I can&amp;rsquo;t get any more followers anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I can&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what that method is :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had to look it up, cause all my ovens are busy so I can&amp;rsquo;t even throw cards into them (without starting) to jog by memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But good thing I did, because apparently I can convert hirelings into prisoners this way too: and hirelings are a renewable resource!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I can&amp;rsquo;t go off getting hirelings just yet, because my Explore oven is continually busy with expeditions! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll have to shift gears at some point and stop doing expeditions. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to while there&amp;rsquo;s still books to be found—and these demons are good at them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:26 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed by pure fluke to capture two Hunters in short order. Had to put one in the fridge to preserve him for longer than the usual 10 minutes, but now I&amp;rsquo;ve fed two subsequent prisoners to the Red Hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably worthwhile to suspend the next expedition and farm more prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I got a Visions stuck with an unlucky Fascination (an Influence that I thought decayed into nothing actually decayed into Fascination).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I&amp;rsquo;m pretty safe from Visions and Despair, as none of my usual actions generate Fascination or Dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only exception being reading new books, which sometimes produces one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking with @electrondance the other day about Visions, and he&amp;rsquo;d said he&amp;rsquo;d been killed by it after three Fascination came, barely noticeable from paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that was odd, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing dozens and dozens and dozens of paintings and not getting Fascination out of them at all—but I&amp;rsquo;ve been sticking to a strict formula of only putting Notoriety in, and the subject is always the same Pawn. It seemed perfectly safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now: one of my four-notoriety paintings just produced three Mystique, one Contentment, and a Fascination. So now my Visions is even more stuck, and actively hazardous now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:33 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visions is a ridiculously bad bit of design though (and Despair is similar, but only a smidgen less bad). So many actions can generate Fascination pretty much at random. Once Visions has got its hands on a Fascination, it &lt;em&gt;never goes away&lt;/em&gt;, until you feed it a Dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, Dread is pretty hard to generate reliably. What makes this ridiculously bad is that many of the actions that will generate Dread also have a chance of generating Fascination instead. And the Visions will eat that shit up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that means you now have to find another Dread to counteract the second Fascination also. And if the Visions gets its hands on three Fascination, you&amp;rsquo;ve got sixty seconds to feed it a Dread or it&amp;rsquo;s game over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Visions comes into play pretty regular: about once every eight rounds (minutes of game time) or thereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despair works similarly, but eats Dread and needs to be fed Contentment—which is a bit easier and safer to generate, hence why Despair&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up: Visions is a recurring event that has a high risk of killing you, and most of the actions you can take to respond to it are equally likely to make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not an interesting hazard. There&amp;rsquo;s no risk vs. reward decisions involved. It&amp;rsquo;s just a recurring hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:41 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only survived 60+ hours in this single game because (a) I was lucky in the early game while I was still learning this stuff, and (b) because I now exercise caution and hygiene when dealing with Dread and Fascination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get a Dread card, I immediately prioritise generating a Contentment so I can get rid of it before Despair comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when I get a Fascination card, I prioritise generating a Dread (through one of two actions that I believe to be reliable—but very inconvenient).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also by this point in the game I have a generally good idea of which actions are likely to produce Dread and/or Fascination, and simply postpone those actions whenever Despair or Visions (or both!) are in play or coming up in the next round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is boring as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:45 AM - 6 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hunter hazard isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as bad as those: Hunters actually turn up less frequently, and can also be captured, killed, or driven to insanity to get rid of them before they become a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when they do become a threat by creating evidence, there are ways to destroy the evidence before it leads to your arrest. So it&amp;rsquo;s a lot less of a threat of instant death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more importantly, Hunters arriving, then generating evidence, then arresting you happens over three (or maybe four?) individual Suspicion rounds. So almost every time there&amp;rsquo;s several or many rounds between each escalation of the hazard, giving you time to deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that Hunters are a threat to me at all anymore—I have a pet demon that goes and dispatches them within seconds of them arriving—but at least in the early game they&amp;rsquo;re a threat to be reckoned with, that can also be countered in several different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Things draw to a close in &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174664320662/cultist-simulator-day-6"&gt;Day 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>cultistsimulator</tag></post><post id="174664072042" url="https://backslashn.com/post/174664072042" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/174664072042/cultist-simulator-day-4" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-06-07 15:52:01 GMT" date="Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:52:01" unix-timestamp="1528386721" format="markdown" reblog-key="yIr3FBSP" slug="cultist-simulator-day-4" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Cultist Simulator, Day 4</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continued from &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174663971807/cultist-simulator-day-3"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:47 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. I am talking to a Weary Detective (trying to demoralise him), and another Weary Detective has appeared. I immediately turn the conversation to him. Since there can be only one Hunter at a time, I wonder what they will make of each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="468" data-orig-width="772" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/2IjLIjr.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f04e0c9cbfbfe1e429b4f7794e70cc1/tumblr_inline_p9ytilrT6t1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Arrange a meeting with an adversary. 'Perhaps we could parley. Or perhaps I could send something to ambush them.' I'm Talking with a Weary Detective about a different Weary Detective." data-orig-height="468" data-orig-width="772" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/2IjLIjr.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;rsquo;s a matter+antimatter mutual annihilation scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I have found someone—or rather some_thing_—to teach me Deep Mandaic. I think this is the last of the languages in the game to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:51 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when the conversation finishes, it turns out I can drag the two Hunters out of the Talk window in whichever order I please. And it appears the second one I drag out will remove the first one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:09 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed it does. I wonder what would happen if the other Hunters weren&amp;rsquo;t exhausted and you tried this—would you end up with two Hunters after you? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, this let me get rid of my Grim, Idealistic, Mystic detective who was becoming a nuisance. Feels a bit cheap though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:08 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have no clue how to proceed from this plateau I find myself on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I just discovered an additional level of things to grind for &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:29 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just rearranged all my ingredients, items, and lore cards to make room for yet another tier of lore D:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(slight spoilers I suppose)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/MA3GH8D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a3359bf18828cc465349c2bf215ba6b/tumblr_inline_p9ytiljKq41qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Too many cards!" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/MA3GH8D.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:45 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;49 hours into my first game of Cultist Simulator and I only just discovered I can send some of my followers out into the town to earn money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:31 PM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been at this all day and I&amp;rsquo;m still stuck exactly where I was last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m running out of places to send expeditions to. I&amp;rsquo;ve found nearly every book in the game. I&amp;rsquo;ve advanced almost every aspect of lore to the maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing threatens me anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m summoning the highest level, uniquely-named minions. None of this is &lt;em&gt;getting me anywhere&lt;/em&gt; cause there&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m missing that I just can&amp;rsquo;t figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen devs point to Steam reviews with dozens or hundreds of hours in a game, and wonder how they can be negative after the player got that much enjoyment out of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well for starters, maybe it wasn&amp;rsquo;t all enjoyment? And worse: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a huge amount of un-fun time in a game to overwhelm all memory of the parts that were enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where I have reached now: I am loathing this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I just want it over and done with, and I give up trying to figure out what I need to do by playing the game itself. So I&amp;rsquo;m off to google for the thing I&amp;rsquo;ve missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:27 AM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Googling, and searching the steam forums and the subreddit was all surprisingly unhelpful :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m finishing off the last little bits of grinding here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="570" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/F2wuTuE.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc0f5cc42ee40865bd5a65eea233942b/tumblr_inline_p9ytinERmX1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Eleven Mystique cards and eight Notoriety cards." data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="570" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/F2wuTuE.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think people think of me as a mild eccentric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:50 AM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, by re-reading labels I first read days ago, I have discovered something else that I am lacking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I already know I want to get to the Tricuspid Gate, but I can&amp;rsquo;t find any way to do so from the Peacock Door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also any Rite&amp;rsquo;s fifth slot is for Desire. The label says I should use it when I have the Sixth Mark. But I only have the Third Mark, so I guess I need 4th and 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t help me in the slightest, of course! Except maybe as additional keywords to google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t find any way to do anything else right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve run out of books. I&amp;rsquo;ve advanced all the lore to max. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored the hidden secrets exhaustively at each level until they started repeating—except the max level, which is really hard for me to get, but I&amp;rsquo;ve explored once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:01 AM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might call this overkill, but when you&amp;rsquo;re on a hazardous expedition sometimes you just want to be really, really sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure data-orig-height="81" data-orig-width="137" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/I1MTuvL.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7bc28f202407fdaf9589583d4478533b/tumblr_inline_p9ytinzaWZ1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Expedition totals for Edge aspect: 46" data-orig-height="81" data-orig-width="137" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/I1MTuvL.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:18 AM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="888" data-orig-width="1346" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/9zxS3ZC.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/75ae0af42c5b1cde6e61086e29639f5b/tumblr_inline_p9ytin3OTv1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The state of the desk now.

Stuck forever in this limbo, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steam says I&amp;rsquo;ve played 55 hours of this one bloody game of #cultistsimulator. I should probably just give up, since I can&amp;rsquo;t find even the slightest hint of how to progress any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:02 AM - 5 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found a forum post about this same damn point and learnt the answer. The damn red hook card that has come up hundreds of times on this plateau has to be fed a prisoner. And no, not the half-dozen captured Hunters it had got in that time. For no particular reason, they don&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you they don&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GOD FUCKING DAMMIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I COULD HAVE GOT PAST THIS POINT FIFTEEN HOURS AGO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck this game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUCK THIS GAME!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have recovered my composure by &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174664126357/cultist-simulator-day-5"&gt;Day 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>cultistsimulator</tag></post><post id="174663971807" url="https://backslashn.com/post/174663971807" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/174663971807/cultist-simulator-day-3" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-06-07 15:47:34 GMT" date="Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:47:34" unix-timestamp="1528386454" format="markdown" reblog-key="LiX7i3cZ" slug="cultist-simulator-day-3" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Cultist Simulator, Day 3</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continued from &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174663774402/cultist-simulator-day-2"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:26 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got my complaints about Cultist Simulator&amp;rsquo;s user experience, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say this: it hasn&amp;rsquo;t crashed once in 25 hours of play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:57 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIP Elridge. The Lanterns will guide you beyond the Mansus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elridge, skilled in the Edge aspect, had seen us past countless enemies on expeditions, and captured or dispatched at least half a dozen Hunters who imperiled us. But this time he never returned, and the Hunter remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:08 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no, we&amp;rsquo;re fucked. After Elridge failed, I sent Victor after the Weary Detective too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victor has not returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:16 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hiring Professional Muscle now to deal with this tenacious Hunter. I ought never to have risked my Disciples on such mundane errands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learnt this harsh lesson now, but too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:37 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the Professional Muscle also has failed to return! Has the Weary Detective defeated him too, or merely bribed him? Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, too, am Weary: of this Hunter and his seeming imperviousness. But I have no more earthly forces to send after him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I shall have to use Unearthly force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have summoned a demon of Edge and Winter. This detective will not survive. Of this I am certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:05 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the demon seek to twist my words and subvert my commands? The detective still lives. But captured, now. I shall leave him sweltering in my dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:07 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one weary detective lies shuddering and forgotten in a blind cell, another has arisen to trouble us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What ardour drives these fellows? Why do they recklessly ignore the fate of their forebears? With a sigh, I send my demon out on the errand again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one did not survive. My demon returned grinning, matched by the rictus of the detective&amp;rsquo;s corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:33 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have rearranged my cards so I can see what Lore I am missing, and what Lore I can upgrade or subvert. And also to align the many Tools and Ingredients I have with the Lore of the same Aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Ir37Xjj.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/875f168223f2c5ce2f5a60837ecb3be9/tumblr_inline_p9yx50IRoG1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Lots of cards. A little more organised now." data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Ir37Xjj.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And only now do I realise that they are colour-coded by their Aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned recently: send demons away on expeditions, they&amp;rsquo;re really good at dealing with obstacles &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:44 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not quite good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O my arch-demon of Edge and Winter! O slayer of Hunters and devourer of shins! O ice-cold eyes and frozen heart! You have vanished in the forest, and gone wherever lost demons go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:58 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what became of the detective I imprisoned? I woke one night whelmed in exotic cravings. An urgent need to speak with the prisoner. All through the night we talked: debating, reasoning, arguing. When dawn came my mind was once more at rest—and the prisoner no more to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:06 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second demon I sent on the expedition? It also failed to return. These vertiginous blundering diaboli are as useless as my feeble craving disciples. If they had not already perished, I would vent my wrath upon them now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funniest thing about that is I only sent them on the expedition because it was there, and because I could. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any need compelling me to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:10 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now learnt a fifth dead language: Phrygian. Three books written in it are awaiting translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I dream through the Stag&amp;rsquo;s Door in search of powerful Influences; and continue my slow and painful exegesis of the lesser Lores in search of the key to the next door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:43 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weary detective is dogging my steps, somehow tirelessly. I hired a hulking fellow to go bother him, but without much hope of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the fellow returned, bearing a body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:45 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I begin a newly-learned rite: I am calling on the Cartographer of Scars to animate the thing into shambling half-life. Perhaps it will be useful for odd jobs around the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:53 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rite failed. The corpse arose, but could not be controlled. Not allowing myself to panic, I used my intellect to banish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rite was a failure, but nothing of value was lost. Perhaps my next attempt will succeed better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:09 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to summon another Maid-in-the-Mirror to take on dangerous tasks. The ritual wavered; I continued the invocation more passionately, but to no avail. The creature is loose. It seeks something mortal to devour. I may have only seconds left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:13 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am spared! It whispered past me, fluttering through the air in search of sustenance. Of all the disciples it could have taken in its jaws, it has chosen the most powerful, who was deepest initiated into our mysteries. It has taken Cat Caro, my Seer, and is devouring her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall have to get the health and safety inspectors in to see if there&amp;rsquo;s a better way of containing these demons. I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose disciples like this: what would become of my cult without followers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is actually a very significant loss: there are very few followers who are able to be promoted to Seer. Cat Caro was one; another perished in an expedition before I had discovered the ceremonies to uplift Seers. There is one more: my last Seer. I hope he lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:21 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what is this? The demon has been entrammelled again, and banished. And Cat Caro lives! What occulted power does she wield?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here I was thinking &amp;ldquo;Seer&amp;rdquo; was not much more than a ceremonial title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:12 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinding, grinding, grinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading and subverting lore to try to find the one I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passing the time by summoning more demons and hiring more thugs, and sending them on expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all quite tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who&amp;rsquo;d have thought being a cult leader would be so unglamorous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:22 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I said much about the writing in Cultist Simulator? It&amp;rsquo;s rich and intense, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not drenched in words as Sunless Sea was. Not a full buffet, but a platter of delectable treats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultist Simulator protip: if you ever feel stuck and don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do next, do the ritual to summon one of these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="368" data-orig-width="402" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Vq8K1VH.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7269bf9482af6c0cbf6f79189719f16b/tumblr_inline_p9yx51iLBJ1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A card.

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:36 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have uncovered a new source of vitality that had hitherto been hidden. It&amp;rsquo;s of uncertain reliability and takes a somnolent quantity of time to pursue, but may be of value if utilised on top of the usual fresh air and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around the same time, I chanced upon a marvelous, delicate technique that can preserve a little vitality far beyond its normal duration!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using all these things in concert, I have succeeded in increasing my health to a robust five. I fancy I can increase it at will in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more vital than that, I have—after long and arduous research and cross-referencing—discovered the entrance to the Spider Door. I wonder what biquadrupedal revelations are preserved beyond it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:23 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found my way from the Spider Door to the Peacock&amp;rsquo;s Door. &amp;ldquo;The Peacock&amp;rsquo;s Door does not open, exactly.&amp;rdquo; What, exactly does it do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am afraid to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:47 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a bug in Cultist Simulator about five times: if autosave happens to kick in while a window is being opened or closed (it was Talk this time, but happened with many), then the game stops responding to mouse clicks. Have to save then reload to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more detail: when the bug happens, the window (if it was opening) disappears. And the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop responding to mouse clicks entirely: it just thinks every mouse click is for info on something in the window, so just shows an info window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can&amp;rsquo;t click on any cards, or pan around the desk, or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HUD still works, so I can save &amp;amp; quit. Then when I reload the game, it loads with the window in question visible, and everything&amp;rsquo;s back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:56 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, bugs aside…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a pretty strong team for this expedition, although it seems they forgot to bring matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="596" data-orig-width="884" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/n8DFqrU.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f8bff3937c74c11ab74fa9f4c43a28c/tumblr_inline_p9yx51aCV01qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The expedition window's title reads: 'Our strength is matchless.'" data-orig-height="596" data-orig-width="884" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/n8DFqrU.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:07 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odd. My hireling and my demons came back from that expedition with their timers rounded up to the nearest minute: two of them were back to their full 180s timers, one at 120s, and one (that had been close to expiry) at 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:20 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="410" data-orig-width="628" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/1hppwTz.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/75f920e283c4062128197931d7a0b147/tumblr_inline_p9yx52kTVm1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="I Am Seeing Things.

I&amp;rsquo;m fucked, aren&amp;rsquo;t I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:30 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe… maybe not? &amp;ldquo;I Am Seeing Things&amp;rdquo; finishes collecting the third Fascination in 3.6s. Meanwhile my desperate dreams of Reason have led me into nightmares, which will deliver a Dread in 6s. Will that be what I need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="372" data-orig-width="570" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/7Ykbtax.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/61cff3ac7f155b7abea09c46c67f8a99/tumblr_inline_p9yx53mCHG1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Hersault's Nightmare: 'Down I go'.

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="353" data-orig-width="576" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/EYnLcxn.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/46529d43e9279ad32c19b1bb9b0abd2d/tumblr_inline_p9yx53kYlo1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Old Unhappy Far-off Things.

I am about to unpause and find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:33 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1.9 seconds my Dream will end, delivering the Dread I need just in time. I&amp;rsquo;m not dead yet, thank the Hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="553" data-orig-width="702" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/7Z99vQW.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab8bfd8ae0153ccd22a28f877b664024/tumblr_inline_p9yx535BI41qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Help Me — 'What is the light that brims the surface of everything?

Time for more reasonable dreams—and hope they don&amp;rsquo;t end in Fascination. It was one such not very long ago that supplied the second Fascination for those visions, in fact! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:41 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis is over, but the danger is not yet abated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as I dream, I continue my translations from Fucine (the sixth dead language I learned, the language of witches) as my minions pursue their expedition in The Rending Mountains (three thousand mile—or was it years?—away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should count myself lucky that this was the first time my Visions had encompassed three Fascinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even more lucky that the Moth principle turned up (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where from) with that Restlessness while the Visions were rising, and that my Dreams rolled the Dread I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, that&amp;rsquo;s the closest I&amp;rsquo;ve come to death in about 35 hours of play (yes, this is still my first game of Cultist Simulator).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what others have told me of their games, death usually comes much more often, and much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:59 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to get more Dread, and meanwhile another Fascination has turned up. So I&amp;rsquo;m back to two! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:01 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another Moth has flown by, delivering another Restlessness. There is something more than chance at work here, I am sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:06 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was working on the Visions crisis, yet another Hunter turned up on my tail. I ignored him for a while, since my minions were busy and I had more important things to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;rsquo;s still there now, and I was about to send a nasty demon after him—but first I looked up other ways to get Dread [yes, 35 hours in I&amp;rsquo;m okay with looking up the odd tip], and turns out—I&amp;rsquo;d even done this earlier in the game but forgotten!—that talking to a Hunter about Winter lore has a chance to terrify them. And doing so will always produce Dread. Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="708" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/2puJuWO.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8a51a1b7dd13df7f5bfac8ea1ef2fdd/tumblr_inline_p9yx54XwVT1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="'Let's speak of endings. Let's speak of the declining sun.

&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. I was so caught up with the Visions, that I failed to pay attention to my Affliction getting worse. It has now matured into Decrepitude, decreasing my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I know of a ritual that can help here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:15 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haha, my latest dream of Reason has also descended into a nightmare which will produce Dread. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have too much of it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the odd Dread is easy enough for an artist to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, that&amp;rsquo;s enough talking specifics of the game. Back to vagaries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:34 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I managed to dispel those Visions, but more have arisen. And the rite to defeat my decrepitude is feeding them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that excess of Despair I have is also lucky! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:35 PM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new Visions are of a different sort. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered before. Something I don&amp;rsquo;t begin to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="621" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/i5qfHx6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/8edc726fe144e83f7f714de3e5c879e4/tumblr_inline_p9yx54SS5r1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="New Colours.

&lt;p&gt;I have passed the Peacock&amp;rsquo;s Door. I have seen the Worm Museum and the Red Church. I have learnt a sixth dead language, although perhaps one that does not die: &amp;ldquo;Before gods arose from blood, before ever ape stood upright, this was the language heard in the House of the Sun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:10 AM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slowest and painfullest grind in Cultist Simulator is the Lore upgrade. Six 30-second stages, three of which demand a perishable resource—Erudition or Glimmering—or Reason. If you can&amp;rsquo;t meet the demands of each stage as it arises, you usually fail and must start over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely easier to obtain Lore from books, if you can find them, and if you can read them. But high level Lore is rare even from books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s never been clear to me which Lore I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to need: so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get the highest level of each. Perhaps overkill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:43 AM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa whoa whoa! I have just discovered that you can PREDICT when things like Despair and Visions are coming up in the next minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Time tile and the next thing due is shown on the right hand side! My mind is blown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it only took me 40 hours of playing to notice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="441" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Z78tCRb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/58321e79bc39075f02cb5d41444430f1/tumblr_inline_p9yx54WTrX1qzlvtz_540.jpg" data-orig-height="441" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Z78tCRb.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:12 AM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just summoned my first Percussigant, and its description made me laugh aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not telling you what it was: you&amp;rsquo;re going to have the joy of discovering it for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:22 AM - 4 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve hit another huge plateau. For I-don&amp;rsquo;t-know-how-long I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty stuck. I&amp;rsquo;ve passed the time with expeditions and upgrading Lore as much as I can, but I&amp;rsquo;m not making forward progress &lt;em&gt;towards&lt;/em&gt; anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to try to find the Tricuspid Gate, but haven&amp;rsquo;t a clue how to get there. The Peacock Door doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to lead there, cause the only cards I can use with the Peacock Door just take me to the Mansus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s two other hints of something I&amp;rsquo;m missing: I have discovered just one book in yet another dead language, but no idea where to learn how to translate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I found a Gold Spintria, but have no possible use for it. Oh, except as a mediocre ritual ingredient I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this is still going on in &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174664072042/cultist-simulator-day-4"&gt;Day 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>cultistsimulator</tag></post><post id="174663774402" url="https://backslashn.com/post/174663774402" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/174663774402/cultist-simulator-day-2" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-06-07 15:38:54 GMT" date="Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:38:54" unix-timestamp="1528385934" format="markdown" reblog-key="zBWtqQmc" slug="cultist-simulator-day-2" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Cultist Simulator, Day 2</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continued from &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174663690732/cultist-simulator-day-1"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:17 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single most annoying thing right now about Cultist Simulator is trying to arrange cards in the play field. Here&amp;rsquo;s my current setup: you can see how I try to arrange related cards close together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/GkdobZh.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/deb63aa2a4c7ab4a6158596a365e0bc4/tumblr_inline_p9ym4yAyeI1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Lots of cards neatly laid out on a desk, in ordered chaos." data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/GkdobZh.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you drag a card just a fraction too close to another card—and while dragging, the card under your mouse is rotated slightly, so you can&amp;rsquo;t get a pixel-accurate understanding of where it&amp;rsquo;ll drop—then something incredibly annoying happens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game shoves the card that was on the table already—sometimes more than one card too!—out of the way, seemingly randomly to one side or the other. So trying to lay cards down to use space efficiently tends to muck up the layout :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is even more frustrating when the game reads the mouse input wrongly during a drag, so it thinks you dragged the wrong card, or dropped too soon. Which happens quite regularly during the game&amp;rsquo;s lag spikes. (Why a card game has big lag spikes I don&amp;rsquo;t know! But it does.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:39 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to have mastered the art of making intriguing-but-not-quite-suspicious paintings. So while I have this annoying investigator on my tail, I am keeping my Notoriety locked up in a continual series of portraits of this one random hanger-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep generating Mystique, so the investigator isn&amp;rsquo;t going away, but between paintings I get somewhere between 10 and 50 seconds worth of safe time where the Notoriety can expire just a little bit. It takes a very long time to expire it this way, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know any other way of dealing with Notoriety, so as tedious as this is, I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep doing it. Should only take a dozen or so more paintings to get rid of most of it. And in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;m generating absolute shitloads of funds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course while I&amp;rsquo;m making all these paintings, I&amp;rsquo;m not doing anything else of much use. I seem to have reached an enormous plateau that I can&amp;rsquo;t actually advance from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I have one Rite to try at some point, but since the things to use in rites always seem to last only 60 seconds, and I can&amp;rsquo;t (yet?) predict when I&amp;rsquo;ll get one of the aspect that works for this rite, I can&amp;rsquo;t think about trying the Rite until my Work slot is reliably open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reaching vast plateaus from where advancement seems impossible was also my experience with Fallen London)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:31 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out how to learn new Rites now, but haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to do any yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:30 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haaaaah. So of the four Notoriety I was slowly (but safely) expiring through paintings, two had expired, and the other two were down to 38 and 29 seconds respectively: almost done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I accidentally went on another expedition, so got another one :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve got seventeen billion more paintings to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know any other way to deal with Notoriety, and I&amp;rsquo;m not leaving it out in the open for five minutes for this cop to find and create evidence from, because evidence is even harder to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:30 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, mistimed a pause, and the investigator got that last Notoriety after all :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:32 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a thing about the design of Cultist Simulator is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain much to you. You have to experiment to learn how to do pretty much anything in the game. It&amp;rsquo;s a design principle very suited to the fiction of the game, where you&amp;rsquo;re digging in occult mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the early game, this principle works really well, because there&amp;rsquo;s so much to discover! How to recruit followers; how to obtain lore; how to translate books; how to earn more Health, Reason, and Passion; how to deal with investigators… and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the mid (late?) game this principle becomes a burden as you exhaust avenues of opportunity available to you. Because you only discover ways to do things by trying them, there will be ways you don&amp;rsquo;t find because you didn&amp;rsquo;t try every thing on every other thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That&amp;rsquo;s a small exaggeration, because every card has an &amp;ldquo;aspect&amp;rdquo; trait that must match a slot to go into it. But there are many slots that accept numerous aspects, and a few that accept all aspects.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, having almost lost earlier at the hands of a hunter who turned my Notoriety into evidence which I only resolved with great difficulty, I was definitely not going to allow this new hunter a chance to get new evidence (until I made a mistake, but never mind that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way I have discovered to keep Notoriety out of the hands of a hunter is to keep it locked away being used for something else. And the only way to lock it away that I have discovered is to use it in a painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There might be other ways to deal with Notoriety besides letting it time out (which takes five whole minutes—and its clock won&amp;rsquo;t tick down at all while it&amp;rsquo;s in use on a painting!), but with this Hunter actively and continually on my trail, I have no way to discover them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any kind of clue what it might be. Maybe talking to my followers about it might have some effect? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, while I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending hours and hours making paintings, keeping this Notoriety locked away except for 10-second periods between paintings (the 10 seconds is because a painting takes slightly less time to make than the hunter does to investigate one harmless Mystique), I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time to poke at other things, but still found very few new avenues of new things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve bought almost every book from both shops. I&amp;rsquo;ve recruited more than twenty followers. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned four dead languages. I&amp;rsquo;ve amassed a motley collection of lore, and an assortment of tools and ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different levels of lore in each of the different aspects—but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to upgrade lore except by combining duplicates of a lower level lore, and there are so few duplicates! So I can&amp;rsquo;t really advance any of my lore at all, and most of it feels useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the mistake I made by accidentally letting the Hunter get the Notoriety at least has freed me from being stuck in the make-paintings rut for another hour or two! Which means my Work oven will at last become free for other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the only avenues I know of to poke at that I haven&amp;rsquo;t exhausted yet are:
- Try performing some rites (to what end? I don&amp;rsquo;t know) with the Work slot.
- Study the remaining books (slow, and not of great help)
- Do a few more expeditions (very slow, risky, but gives a few items)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean I&amp;rsquo;m nearing the end of the game? At this point I hope so, because otherwise I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to end up pretty frustrated by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s a few commissions I could do for some patrons too: but they also need the work slot, and the one I already did doesn&amp;rsquo;t suggest those will lead to anything new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:08 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now I have a few Rites and a free Work oven, I have found that actually getting a Rite to work requires very specific combinations of things that I either don&amp;rsquo;t have, or will take a lot of dragging cards around to discover :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what the Rites will do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:13 PM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a combination that at least lets me press the Start button! Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m going to be summoning the mysterious Name known as the Baldomerian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/8nuKRFk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/d9310e7e8c0a7790d8c11e356e451896/tumblr_inline_p9ym4znIdj1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A mighty force of Lantern to draw the Baldomerian's attention, and a teasing taste of secrets to bring her closer." data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/8nuKRFk.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I summoned this person or thing, and now what? They have a three minute timer on them, and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be able to do anything with them. :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to resort to googling for the answers, but the opacity here really tempts me to, especially combined with the apparent scarcity of things to experiment with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess I&amp;rsquo;m painting a picture of this thing I summoned then &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:15 AM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I summoned one of the Voiceless Dead, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything to do with them. So then I used them as the sacrifice in another Rite—which turned out to be for removing Decrepitude, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all quite frustrating. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the Rites which permanently destroy some of the things used in them, which is a fucking huge problem if you have to experiment to figure them out. And if it takes 16 hours of the game to get to the point of being able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the moment I&amp;rsquo;ve given up on Rites, because I just don&amp;rsquo;t know what they&amp;rsquo;re for or why. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m studying the remaining books and sending expeditions to the remaining locations, because I don&amp;rsquo;t know what else to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:37 AM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/XoVedGJ.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/866f565d3e60e4a6e11cf598597a8501/tumblr_inline_p9ym50Qy0x1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Confusion. Also lots of cards." data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/XoVedGJ.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;No clue what to do: the books are only yielding low-level lore; the commissions yielding little of value; the expeditions bearing little fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no more potential recruits to be found; no more books to buy; no more patrons to engage; few if any new locations to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long, slow, bitter, drawn-out end to the game—is that really it? What did I miss? ☹️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:42 AM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there was one specific pairing of cards I needed to use. One of the two was reasonably obvious, but the other one needed to be one specific Lore card: not a lower-level one, nor a higher-level one, nor one of the same level from a different Aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d already tried a bunch of different lore cards, including a level 6 and a level 10 of this very same Aspect. Is this the only place where a higher-level Lore card won&amp;rsquo;t substitute for a lower-level one? Only one I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, at any rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had twenty-three different Lore cards (but not a full set). I&amp;rsquo;d tried about eight or nine different ones in this recipe, and they all failed. You can probably see how I thought I was on the wrong track entirely, rather than thinking to keep brute force trying every single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exasperated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I was missing wasn&amp;rsquo;t even connected to the Rites at all! So although there were still obviously open possibilities there, all the experimentation I could do with them would&amp;rsquo;ve been futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:51 AM - 3 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that when you have a partially correct, or not quite strong enough combination of cards in a Rite (so that you can&amp;rsquo;t actually begin it), the flavour text hints at what else you might need. This is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Way cards: there was no hint that I needed to find more of them, except the existence of other portals than &amp;ldquo;The Wood&amp;rdquo; on this map. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d heard no mention of these other portals at all—except the Stag Gate, which is mentioned on my Dedication (i.e. objective) card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/ujnI7I6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/65b5cb13da99adbec121b31e3656832b/tumblr_inline_p9ym51pylP1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="The Mansus again." data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/ujnI7I6.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no hint as to how I would find the Stag Gate at all, which is why I had concluded the rituals and summoning would be a part of it (but no: they&amp;rsquo;re not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d actually concluded quite incorrectly that the other gates shown were just different early portals or different objectives that other playthroughs would have instead of The Wood and the Stag Door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d have been quitting the game soon in fact—if @electrondance hadn&amp;rsquo;t pointed out that he had found The White Door (though he couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall how), and it was probably the thing I was missing. And it was indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The grind persists in &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174663971807/cultist-simulator-day-3"&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>cultistsimulator</tag></post><post id="174663690732" url="https://backslashn.com/post/174663690732" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/174663690732/cultist-simulator-day-1" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-06-07 15:35:10 GMT" date="Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:35:10" unix-timestamp="1528385710" format="markdown" reblog-key="fDh3Q5eW" slug="cultist-simulator-day-1" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Cultist Simulator, Day 1</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;6:51 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out Cultist Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions:
- mysterious and obscure, which is exactly what I hoped for
- font size is way too small ☹️ — can zoom, but it zooms the whole playfield
- music is great and eerie
- no fan of timers, but waiting to see if they&amp;rsquo;re important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also very much not a fan of Unity&amp;rsquo;s default config dialog (it&amp;rsquo;s always been bad). I want to remap some keys, but have to quit and restart the game to do so &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="433" data-orig-width="466" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/P6qqCea.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/d240f231c5e643ddc82fb5c9c84fa920/tumblr_inline_p9ym4yvuv91qzlvtz_540.png" alt="The configuration dialog for Cultist Simulator, showing keys for Fire buttons and Jump buttons." data-orig-height="433" data-orig-width="466" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/P6qqCea.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, these aren&amp;rsquo;t actually the controls for the game &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, seems key remapping will come later: &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/718670/discussions/0/1697174779850943755/"&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/app/718670/discussions/0/1697174779850943755/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, back to the game then. I guess for now I&amp;rsquo;ll have to manage as best I can with the interface issues. (At least, unlike The Final Station, the text size isn&amp;rsquo;t preventing me from playing the game)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the other first impression of Cultist Simulator:
- the writing is sinister and delicious, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="441" data-orig-width="694" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/xyLuwwv.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fdb82a9e7db41f327755339d5ff497b/tumblr_inline_p9ym4zbn3S1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt='A card reads: "Sometimes, I have dreamt of a tall woman in a sand-coloured coat, who stands at the foot of my bed, smiling as she watches me sleep. In that dream, she turns her head with the swiftness of a bird, and her fingers flex like talons. I do not think I dreamt of her last night. If I had, I could not have slept so soundly.&amp;amp;quot' data-orig-height="441" data-orig-width="694" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/xyLuwwv.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:31 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further impressions:
- icon overload! I have to keep clicking on everything to remember what all these icons mean! Labels—or mouseover text if you must—would help me a lot here.
- lots and lots of waiting for timers. There&amp;rsquo;s no auto-pause when a timer finishes :-/
- terribly confused why a bunch of timers finish up &lt;em&gt;and then start all over again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="799" data-orig-width="777" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/IObpbqC.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/12846c7241b9cf76e355b1d9bb7b8f0d/tumblr_inline_p9ym4zhmWK1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A bunch of icons. Who knows what they mean? I can't remember." data-orig-height="799" data-orig-width="777" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/IObpbqC.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amusingly the tiny cards have labels, just these big things don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/pWc7P4p.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/5add4cda80fd9bc890cbad1ea260bbd1/tumblr_inline_p9ym4zic0A1qzlvtz_540.jpg" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/pWc7P4p.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having zoomed in—in order to be able to read the text— various UIs now pop up with their buttons clipped off the bottom of the screen  Also there&amp;rsquo;s a horrible shadowy vignette hanging over the top part of the window, so I can&amp;rsquo;t pan down to use the whole window area &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:37 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the freeform UI in general, but it&amp;rsquo;s got rather a lot of fiddly bits. Like tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of cards multiplies, I keep moving them around to try and keep things in an order that makes sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the game snaps them off elsewhere according to its own labyrinthine logic, often panning the camera away as it does so. Infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have dealt with the vignette for the moment by placing my two Dread cards beneath it. There they wait, enshadowed, as their own counters tick down to an obscure, ominous ending…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:11 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are seventeen different timers on my screen right now. Only twelve of them are indicated unless I mouseover some of the cards. But even those twelve are overwhelming: I can&amp;rsquo;t keep track of which ones are where and how far down they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The font for the numeric counters: extreme differences in stress render the figures a little indistinct; the spacing is odd. The figures are constantly animating too. I can&amp;rsquo;t read the counters at a glance, but have to pause the game and fixate briefly on each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only five of the seventeen timers have a graphical indication: a line slowly encircles the icon. Its radius is too large to glimpse out of the corner of my eye; nor does it change in appearance as the timers nears its end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I have to fixate on each, on its top left corner, to see if it&amp;rsquo;s nearly done. This continuous scanning and fixation is tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:31 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cult has abducted its first prisoner. Only time will tell if they will end up as a new follower, or a new victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:35 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect (pun!) of the self-restarting timers now makes sense to me: if the thing opened up an empty slot, then the current timer is how long I have to fill the slot; the subsequent timer is it using whatever I put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if the card that you slot in has its own timer, it is paused while it is in the slot. If the time-to-fill-the-slot is long, you could use this to prolong a card&amp;rsquo;s life, taking it back out for some other use before the time-to-fill expires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:54 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something&amp;rsquo;s shadow has passed over my desk… was it the moon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8:57 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="265" data-orig-width="335" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/TEVM4xt.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0b1ca37bd96c398b891480babe088d77/tumblr_inline_p9ym50OJcR1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="Six Mystique cards" data-orig-height="265" data-orig-width="335" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/TEVM4xt.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few people in the city attract so much interest without a clear cause. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the way you style your hair?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:00 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have sent my disciple on an expedition. Perhaps she can uncover useful secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9:05 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something strange and glorious has just occurred!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/P0W8sSi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/6739f66078d32c9b7d6bb6ae20db7254/tumblr_inline_p9ym50IZZN1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A map of the Mansus. I have entered through The Wood, and can see other doors in the distance: The White Door; The Spider Door; The Stag Door." data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1770" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/P0W8sSi.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:56 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have four followers and two minions. I&amp;rsquo;ve sent one of the latter, a hulking fellow, after the investigator that has been dogging my steps and amassing evidence. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope he can capture or subdue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I struggle with the mysteries of my cult; I want to deepen the faith of my followers, yet I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found the right rituals…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the timers: yeah, I think they mostly work. I&amp;rsquo;d still prefer turn-based, but now that I kinda get how they function, it makes sense. I&amp;rsquo;d still prefer them to be more at-a-glance parseable, but you can&amp;rsquo;t have everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:03 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultist Simulator is in essence a cooking game: I have five ovens, titled Work, Dream, Study, Explore, and Talk. Then there&amp;rsquo;s numerous customers: Time demands money, and other customers demanding more exotic recipes come and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I put the right ingredients into the Work oven, I get money out the other side. So I repeat the same few recipes continuously to feed Time. I put varying recipes into the other ovens to generate new ingredients or discover new recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary ingredients are money, health, passion, and reason. Passion and Reason are herbs whose leaves enhance recipes, but take time to grow back. Funds I can spend as long as I have them. Health is key to many things, but always comes with a risk of hurting myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:17 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have captured the Hunter that dogged our trail, but another has arisen to take her place. I would send my minion after him, but he&amp;rsquo;s busy on another errand. And I&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay him again, before long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile my Work alternates between a day job and my real passion: painting. My wild imagination and notoriety means my paintings earn me quite a lot of money! But I barely have time to squeeze them in between leaving the office and arriving the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally: I have 0.3 seconds left on the day job&amp;rsquo;s timer to put it into the Work box again, or I&amp;rsquo;ll get demoted and end up with less money and some negative side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:22 PM - 1 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa: my latest painting sold for six funds. SIX FUNDS! That&amp;rsquo;s the Cultist Simulator equivalent of like ten million pounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the day job pays a measly two, and takes twice as long to do so! I should quit and devote my working hours to the brush and palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;12:17 AM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first expedition ended ignominiously: my followers searched and searched for a hidden door, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand how expeditions worked, so kept throwing funds at it thinking that would help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t: turns out I was just paying for my followers to have a lovely long holiday at a swanky hotel. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s my guess anyway: nobody keeps receipts in this cult. It&amp;rsquo;s financial madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second expedition ended in tragedy: one of the two followers sent on it was killed by the guardians of whatever-the-place-was. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1:40 AM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My latest expedition was technically successful: we reached the treasure. We just also happened to collect a small curse as we went by. Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2:25 AM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the most annoying bit of Cultist Simulator is how obstacles to an expedition are completely random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That expedition I failed cause we didn&amp;rsquo;t find a hidden door? I went back there again with the right team for finding a hidden door: but it&amp;rsquo;s a different obstacle now &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because failing expeditions tends to cause followers to die and/or curses to spring up, guess what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And skills that followers have also appear to be random, so basically need strong skills across the board to do &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; expeditions. Or dumb luck. Frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also getting a billion short-lived cards that say they can be helpful in rituals for summoning minions—but how do you learn new rituals? Absolutely no clue, after many hours of play. Weird cliffs difficulty due to obscured knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surviving just fine. Pouring my followers into the expedition grindstone. But not really making any headway on advancement. Don&amp;rsquo;t know how to learn new rituals. Don&amp;rsquo;t know how to advance my followers beyond Believer status. (Not asking for hints—just expressing frustration)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, I&amp;rsquo;m wrong about the expedition obstacles being randomised: I was getting two different locations mixed up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5:47 AM - 2 Jun 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve now figured out how to advance my followers. Also how to compensate for shortcomings in their skills in the meantime. I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt how to approach an unknown expedition with minimal risk. I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt how to translate books in dead languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;rsquo;m doing a whole lot better now than I was a few hours ago. But I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing all night, so I certainly ought to be doing better! I think Cultist Simulator is the first game that I&amp;rsquo;ve done an all-nighter on since Civilization IV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The story continues in &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/174663774402/cultist-simulator-day-2"&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>cultistsimulator</tag></post><post id="173632242812" url="https://backslashn.com/post/173632242812" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/173632242812/thief-ii-the-vocal-age" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-05-06 08:52:29 GMT" date="Sun, 06 May 2018 09:52:29" unix-timestamp="1525596749" format="markdown" reblog-key="zr147W5u" slug="thief-ii-the-vocal-age" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Thief II: The Vocal Age</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;This follows on from &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/173628712752/thief-told"&gt;my second post about Thief&amp;rsquo;s facial animation feature&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/173587220222/thief-the-speech-project"&gt;the first post is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was finished. All that was needed now was to make a demo to show it off…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is ever that easy, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that it was clear that the feature was only in Thief 2, rather than the demo being some random guard humming and mumbling to himself, instead there was an obvious conversation to use to show off the feature: the archers of Lady Van Vernon and Master Willey hurling insults at each other across the rooftops, from Life of the Party. So I immediately set work on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I added a second archer to the test map, this time the one with the purple shirt. And quickly hacked a copy of his textures with the same sketched mouths as the first (red-shirted) archer. Loaded up the map and checked that he, too, moved his mouth when coughing and muttering. Good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the speech schemas for the conversation in question just needed a quick look at &lt;code&gt;CONV.SCH&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...

//////////////////////////////////
//MISSION 11 - LIFE OF THE PARTY//
//////////////////////////////////

//c1101 -Stand off
schema sg11101A     //"...And I'm telling you.."
archetype AI_CONV
sg11101A
schema_voice vguard1  1 c1101  (LineNo 1 1)

schema sg51101B
archetype AI_CONV
sg51101B
schema_voice vguard5 1 c1101  (LineNo 2 2)

...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was back to Dromed and &lt;code&gt;find_obj sg11101A&lt;/code&gt; and so on to select the schemas one by one in the Object Hierarchy, and add the Sound &amp;gt; Motion property to each. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s a better process to do this en masse than manually, but for just eight schemas the manual steps are fine. And so I regenerated &lt;code&gt;facepos.str&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now conversations in Thief use the so-called pseudoscripts provided by the AI &amp;gt; Conversation property. A pseudoscript is basically a bunch of actions that can be performed: play a sound schema or a motion schema, turn to face a particular direction, move to someplace, add or remove a metaproperty (for behavioural changes), and so on. Due to the high barrier to writing custom &lt;code&gt;.osm&lt;/code&gt; scripts for the game (the script language is basically a custom C++ preprocessor), many fan mission designers&amp;ndash;I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked to see if the same is true of the official missions!&amp;ndash;also used this pseudoscript system for other scripted behaviours. So anyway, I needed a conversation setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I opened up the Life of the Party mission and found the object there that drove the archers&amp;rsquo; conversation. With my usual hacky method for copying a few things between mission files in the editor, I went through each step of the conversation and screenshotted the edit dialog, pasting them into the copy of Photoshop I always have running. Then I can just refer to the screenshots when copying the stuff into my own mission. There&amp;rsquo;s probably a better way of doing this, but&amp;ndash;knowing Dromed&amp;ndash;doubtful that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better way. And it turned out to be quite a good thing that I copied it this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, I went back to my mission and created a conversation, linked it to my two guards, then went step by step through the eight pages and filled out the speech actions in each (not bothering with the motions and behavioural bits just yet). Added a button to trigger it, hit Alt+G to get into the game, and pushed the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="147" data-orig-width="355" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/It7KEMT.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/255dc695d770a034dfbb52e805cafd59/tumblr_inline_p8bbbk3g5O1qzlvtz_540.png" data-orig-height="147" data-orig-width="355" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/It7KEMT.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure data-orig-height="193" data-orig-width="286" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/wVroku5.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/946d56410ad1366dfc4991e5e2608b91/tumblr_inline_p8bbbladBT1qzlvtz_540.png" data-orig-height="193" data-orig-width="286" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/wVroku5.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking good. And of course I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to save the changes to the test map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the source code again, I found that the speech system helpfully offers a callback interface for other parts of the game to get notified when a line of dialog plays; but it&amp;rsquo;s only used in two places: the face animation uses this to know when to start and stop animating; and the conversation system uses it to know when a line has finished, so that it can play the next step of the pseudoscript. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem though, cause these kinds of callback systems are always set up to handle multiple callbacks, and &amp;hellip; oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// NOTE: if kCallbackEntryMax is not 1, a crash occurs at the end of a conversation
//   inside SpeechEndCallback, because the first callback causes the speechEndCallbackHash
//   to delete the callback function array, so the second callback ptr is a bullshit ptr - patmc
//#define kCallbackEntryMax 4
#define kCallbackEntryMax 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. So the speech system originally handled up to four different callbacks, but the conversation system didn&amp;rsquo;t manage its own memory properly and so someone hacked the speech system to only support one at a time. The assertion error was a check that the array of callbacks wasn&amp;rsquo;t already full: and since both the face animations and the conversation were trying to register callbacks, the first one in filled up the array. This was not going to be easy to work around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that I knew the source of the assertion failure and why it was happening, I decided to run the test map again and ignore the failure this time. Here be dragons, but I figured they were reasonably polite dragons that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cause much harm. And so once again I pressed the button and got the error, but this time chose Cancel. The game continued, and the first guard proceeded to spout his line of dialog, and stopped. And then the other guard just stared mutely at him. Like he&amp;rsquo;d forgotten his lines. Anyway, this is where it really clicked with me that the conversation system needed the callbacks installed to work properly, otherwise it just never moves on from the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this limit is baked into the code and the statically allocated array of callbacks, it&amp;rsquo;s not really changeable. And who knows if the bug described still exists even if it was changed? (It probably does.) So I had to come up with a different way of handling this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that way was: eight different conversations! One for each line. So thankfully I still had all my screenshots of the conversation setup, so it was straightforward to refer to them again when setting up the eight conversations. But a new problem now: one button wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be enough to set off the conversations properly, so it was time for more hacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a Squirrel script for the button that would turn on the first conversation, wait for a time, then turn on the second conversation, wait again, and so on. I opened up each of the sound files for the conversation in Audacity to get the length, and set the wait times accordingly. And it worked! It&amp;rsquo;s ugly as hell, and painful, and not at all robust enough to use in anything that&amp;rsquo;s going to ship, but it worked. The first guard finished his line, and a fraction of a second later the second conversation was triggered and the second guard remembered to say his line, and so on. At last time for the final spit and polish, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I googled for references for mouth positions for different sounds, and found a ton of cartoon ones, and a few very bland and expressionless photographic ones, and then &lt;a href="https://miko-noire.deviantart.com/art/Mouth-References-436290183"&gt;this one by Miko-Noire&lt;/a&gt; which&amp;ndash;although it&amp;rsquo;s not really for different sounds&amp;ndash;had exactly the amount of liveliness I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="421" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/4W80Zfs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/49d0d579bd9efd7c7d7d87f37aef3d06/tumblr_inline_p8bbbl43mj1qzlvtz_540.jpg" data-orig-height="421" data-orig-width="400" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/4W80Zfs.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I slapped those into the guard textures, and with a bit of slapdash colour alteration, they fit both the light-skinned and dark-skinned guards pretty well. A proper art job would have given them different mouths, of course, and probably also adjusted the cheeks to match. But I&amp;rsquo;m no artist, and this was already looking much better than my temporary version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="256" data-orig-width="512" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/dcWUJ34.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ea32cd0f192c5ee372c88d5adbe1c8bc/tumblr_inline_p8bbbl7CrZ1qzlvtz_540.jpg" data-orig-height="256" data-orig-width="512" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/dcWUJ34.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one final bug waiting for me. You see, the face animation system will animate the face for a speech sample even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an entry in &lt;code&gt;facepos.str&lt;/code&gt;. It just plays a predefined, simplistic animation in a loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// If there's no animation string we change frames in a fixed
// sequence.
static int aTimedAnim[8] = { 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 };
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this had probably been coming up before, but now that the faces looked better and I was paying attention to how they looked, I saw this animation coming up. It was now quite noticeable, because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the neutral &amp;ldquo;mouth closed&amp;rdquo; frame, nor either of the two frames where my new images had the mouth wide open. So now I could see that randomly, one or the other of the guards would just flap their lips continually without ever really opening or closing their mouth: the telltale sign that this animation was being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I spent a lot of time trying to figure this one out. I thought maybe there was a race condition, and so the strings file needed to be preloaded (nope). I thought perhaps the speech samples needed to be preloaded (nope). I thought maybe there sometimes wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough time at the end of one line for the sample to actually finish, so a bit more delay between lines might help (nope). I thought maybe the conversation callbacks were the issue, and that triggering the guards&amp;rsquo; lines through a horrible hack involving AIWatchObj links and teleporting markers around&amp;ndash;but that didn&amp;rsquo;t even work, let alone fix the problem. In the end, I just decided to live with it. In the worst case, I could record multiple takes, and just splice in each guard&amp;rsquo;s line when it actually worked. It&amp;rsquo;d be a pain, but it&amp;rsquo;d work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So finally the last thing I did was throw in a couple of camera markers, and update the script to attach the player&amp;rsquo;s camera to each in turn, so that each guard would get a closeup. Oh, and put into the conversation the motions and behaviour changes needed to make the characters move and then start shooting at each other at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then when I was finally read to record, all eight lines played perfectly, with the correct mouth animations, all on the first take. So maybe there is a Master Builder after all! so here, finally is the result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to muck about with this yourself, you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/adurdin/thiefy-stuff/raw/master/T2%20Face%20Animation%20Demo/t2_face_animation_demo.zip"&gt;download the demo mission from Github&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll need Thief 2 NewDark 1.25 to open it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; NewDark 1.26 has just been released, with this gem in the patch notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- restored "kCallbackEntryMax" (speech callback) limit from 1 to 4 to avoid "i &amp;lt; kCallbackEntryMax" asserts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means using Face Textures should no longer break Conversations, and vice-versa. One could actually ship a mission using this feature now!&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="173628712752" url="https://backslashn.com/post/173628712752" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/173628712752/thief-told" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-05-06 05:38:24 GMT" date="Sun, 06 May 2018 06:38:24" unix-timestamp="1525585104" format="markdown" reblog-key="TjZctu0H" slug="thief-told" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Thief: Told</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;This follows on from &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/173587220222/thief-the-speech-project"&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; about the facial expression &amp;amp; speech animation feature in Thief. The good news is I got it working this time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anything else, I&amp;rsquo;d like to clarify a point from that post: the &lt;code&gt;face_process&lt;/code&gt; command does nothing useful unless you first set the &lt;code&gt;face_path&lt;/code&gt; property. For example this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;set face_path ./strings/
face_process
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will write to &amp;ldquo;./strings/facepos.str&amp;rdquo; relative to the directory Dromed is in. The path is just stuck on the front of the file name, so make sure you have the trailing slash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I followed through on my threat to apply a debugger to Dromed, and that had&amp;hellip; mixed results. I installed Visual Studio, which turned out to be a waste of time since its interface now is quite confusing, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to open a memory view and search for it. And I needed to do that because&amp;ndash;since Dromed.exe doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any symbols&amp;ndash;I needed to locate some of the static strings relating to the feature, such as &amp;ldquo;facepos.str&amp;rdquo;, in order to find identify the actual functions I was interested in. The goal, of course, being to put some breakpoints on the various conditionals in those functions to see which of them was responsible for the thing not actually working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with Visual Studio out of the question, I then decided to try r2 (radare2). Since its focus is the disassembly of undocumented binaries, it&amp;rsquo;s got much better tools for searching. But it&amp;rsquo;s a command line only thing, which is okay, but means doing a bunch more reading in order to learn. But I successfully identified all the interesting functions from face.cpp in it, and so came up with a list of addresses for breakpoints. So then I stuck breakpoints on those addresses and ran Dromed. Well, tried to. For whatever reason, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get Dromed to run with r2 attached. Time to turn to a new debugger!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around it was the venerable Windbg. I fired it up, set up the breakpoints, launched Dromed, and&amp;hellip; nothing. Went between game mode and edit mode a few times. Changed the Face Textures and Face State properties around a bit. The breakpoints just weren&amp;rsquo;t ever being hit. So then I dug through the disassembly a bit more to find the callers of the face functions, so I could put breakpoints further up. So the MeshTex functions got breakpoints too, and those weren&amp;rsquo;t being hit either! Wtf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I was scratching my head over this, I took a closer look at the &lt;code&gt;MeshTexPrerender()&lt;/code&gt; function that calls &lt;code&gt;FacePrerender()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void MeshTexPrerender(ObjID Obj, mms_model *pModel)
{
   sMeshTexRemap *pRemap;

   // Does this object have our special property?
   if (!g_pMeshTexProperty-&amp;gt;Get(Obj, &amp;amp;pRemap)) {
      g_pCurrentModel = 0;
      return;
   }

   ...

   FacePrerender(Obj, pModel);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Look at that if there. The MeshTexPrerender function exits early if its corresponding property isn&amp;rsquo;t present. And so in that case the face stuff never gets called. This is it, I thought, all I need to do is bung the MeshTex property onto my guinea pig guard, and it&amp;rsquo;ll work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d never noticed the MeshTex property (that&amp;rsquo;s Renderer &amp;gt; Mesh Textures to you) before, so I did a quick google to see if anyone had discussed it before, and the very first thing I found was the wiki page for it saying: &amp;ldquo;Not in Thief Gold&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahahahahahahaaa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all this time I&amp;rsquo;d been chasing down this feature, thinking it had been in The Dark Project and cut before release. But no: it appears to have been a new feature for Thief 2. But I&amp;rsquo;d been using the Gold variant of NewDark, which&amp;ndash;although it has the code in there, since NewDark is based off the Thief 2 codebase&amp;ndash;doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the new properties from Thief 2 in game. Even though Dromed will happily let you throw them around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this was the second reason I&amp;rsquo;d seen nothing happening at all. So I quickly set up a Thief 2 NewDark environment with Dromed and all that, and then created a new test mission. I added the Sound &amp;gt; Face Motions property to the guard idle schema. Then I added a guard. Then quickly scribbled a bunch of face variations onto the guard texture and saved them into mesh/txt16. Then added the face textures property and set up the replacements. And finally, stuck the Renderer &amp;gt; Mesh Textures cherry on top of the layer cake of prerequisites. With trepidation I pressed Alt+G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I entered game mode, the guard coughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND HIS MOUTH ANIMATED ALONG WITH THE SOUND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine just hung open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relief and surprise and joy mixed together. So the feature does work after all! It just needed Thief 2, and this extra property. I took a much-needed break for a cup of tea, and tweeted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have cracked the case of the mouth animations in Thief. Stay tuned for a demo coming soon…&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Durdin (@adurdin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/992923434198949888"&gt;May 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was finished. All that was needed now was to make a demo to show it off&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/173632242812/thief-ii-the-vocal-age"&gt;read more in part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="173587220222" url="https://backslashn.com/post/173587220222" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/173587220222/thief-the-speech-project" type="regular" date-gmt="2018-05-04 21:42:54 GMT" date="Fri, 04 May 2018 22:42:54" unix-timestamp="1525470174" format="markdown" reblog-key="Iu7HqTmU" slug="thief-the-speech-project" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Thief: The Speech Project</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;While working on my upcoming Thief mission, I noticed an intriguing property in Dromed: Renderer &amp;gt; Face Textures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure data-orig-height="181" data-orig-width="265" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/fOkSmkm.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a4e56c99345197ff874fbe6a2e0004b/tumblr_inline_p884f0TsPx1qzlvtz_540.png" data-orig-height="181" data-orig-width="265" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/fOkSmkm.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smiling, wincing, and stunned faces? I had my surprised face on at any rate. Thief never changed NPC&amp;rsquo;s faces, did it? If I added this property to an object, the game crashed. Ah, obviously this is dead code relating to a feature cut long before the game shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got more interesting though: when I added this property to an object, it also dropped in this related state property: Renderer &amp;gt; Face State&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure data-orig-height="147" data-orig-width="265" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/g7P0dvI.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/470d08c9021b926fed3f808f213f0032/tumblr_inline_p884f0Juen1qzlvtz_540.png" data-orig-height="147" data-orig-width="265" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/g7P0dvI.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this &amp;ldquo;talking&amp;rdquo; bit about? Well this made me remember an oddity in the list of Dromed commands that I&amp;rsquo;d half noticed earlier, but not really paid attention to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;face_process        :  find textures to match speech samples.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;textures to match speech samples. Does this mean Thief at one point had&amp;ndash;not just NPC faces changing to match their emotional state, but also animated mouths when they talked? That&amp;rsquo;d be a big deal. Valve had been making a big deal of their feature in Half-Life that animated an NPC&amp;rsquo;s mouth in real time to match their speech. Huh. I did a little more poking around in Dromed and found another property that seemed related: Sound &amp;gt; Face Motions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure data-orig-height="89" data-orig-width="265" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Q8NCb1V.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f8dd8ca262264f1adce6a535fa072ea/tumblr_inline_p884f1abTJ1qzlvtz_540.png" data-orig-height="89" data-orig-width="265" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/Q8NCb1V.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was well and truly interested now, and decided to do some digging. First point of call was the Thief 2 source code, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to find the corresponding code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="165" data-orig-width="506" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/p2hz6ck.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a3d17e48e066b3a229cf0f468800b73/tumblr_inline_p884f3AHHa1qzlvtz_540.png" data-orig-height="165" data-orig-width="506" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/p2hz6ck.png"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having poked through the face code and the rendering code a little, it does look as though all the code for this feature remained in the game. Having read the code a little more carefully, and done some tests in Dromed, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;face_process&lt;/code&gt; command in Dromed will generate a file &lt;code&gt;facepos.str&lt;/code&gt; with animation frames for all speech samples whose schemas have the Sound &amp;gt; Face Motions property turned on. Here&amp;rsquo;s a small sample I generated with it, from a hammerite muttering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hm1a0mu1:"14444313441431111144314441445415533444454554443144440110000"
hm1a0mu2:"033111011111111111113114411444444441144414411141110100455555354441545431144444444541111145554443444441414543334311411114444113103431111100000000"
hm1a0mu3:"0155444110011111111111244411410111144444112421111011010000410100000011121112541414211111111044411114414222124411111141214211000214112100004104422210141111210441210000000"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these strings is a sequence of frames for a 16-frame-per-second facial animation for the sample in question. Each digit relates to one of the following mouth positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;0: neutral
1: small oh
2: small ee
3: big oh
4: big ee
5: shout
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see how well these generated frames corresponded to the speech, so here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;hm1a0mu3&lt;/code&gt; alongside a set of simple faces that I drew and animated with a bit of javascript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BqYCRsuXPY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but having made that animation, I was now really keen to see if I could get this working in the game somehow. Now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t got it working at all yet, but I have got as far as having it not crash when I use the Renderer &amp;gt; Face Textures property. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the Neutral/Smile/Wince/Surprise/Stunned textures should be the prefix of a set of textures in the mesh/txt and mesh/txt16 folders for each of these visages (to use the term from the source code). Let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;d put in &lt;code&gt;guardneut&lt;/code&gt; for the neutral visage. Now if this visage won&amp;rsquo;t support mouth animations, then I only need to create the &lt;code&gt;guardneut1.gif&lt;/code&gt; texture for this visage. If it does support animations, then I also need &lt;code&gt;guardneut2.gif&lt;/code&gt; and so on up to &lt;code&gt;guardneut6.gif&lt;/code&gt;. Here the digits 1-6 correspond to neutral, small oh, smalle ee, big oh, big ee, and shout, respectively. Note that while the frames in &lt;code&gt;facepos.str&lt;/code&gt; start at zero, the texture names start at one, presumably to make them more artist-friendly. Strange that the programmers didn&amp;rsquo;t also do the same for the page numbering in book files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="531" data-orig-width="595" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/vRpjtZV.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/44ce2167d793dd0b9cd3ea8ce3dd3df6/tumblr_inline_p884f36Foi1qzlvtz_540.jpg" data-orig-height="531" data-orig-width="595" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/vRpjtZV.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But anyway, once I had the numbered textures in place, and set the visage names to the appropriate prefixes, the game no longer crashed when the guard starting talking. It didn&amp;rsquo;t swap out the texture at all, but it was clearly doing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s as far as I&amp;rsquo;ve got just now. I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a firm handle on what the &amp;ldquo;texture to replace&amp;rdquo; field should contain, and how it corresponds to the texture name baked into the model file. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to need to use a debugger for the next bit, to break when it&amp;rsquo;s checking the materials to replace so I can really see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. So expect an update sometime after I do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiders in Thief and Thief 2 really freak me out. The way they look, they way they sound, the way they &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;—ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not so bad that I can’t play the game, but it makes parts of it really hard. For a friend of mine, it’s even worse: he can’t bear to play the first Thief at all because of all the spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="http://www.sshock2.com/showarchive.asp?month=11&amp;amp;year=2002"&gt;Jocke’s no-spider patch for System Shock 2&lt;/a&gt;, I have done the same for Thief Gold and Thief 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch makes all the spiders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friendly to the player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacked by other AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have only one hit point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die as soon as the level starts anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look like a small white mossy stone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invisible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teleported out of the level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big spiders, small spiders, chaos spiders, spiderbots: all are either completely gone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download it &lt;a href="https://github.com/adurdin/thiefy-stuff/raw/master/No%20Spiders/ThiefNoSpiders2.zip"&gt;from Github&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://mega.nz/#!OyJ31DqK!kSw-OtSGEF-B3i30587SlZ1cHDPOaxf7_UpdfBdtNSw"&gt;from Mega&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old version of the patch, for non-NewDark versions of Thief can still be downloaded &lt;a href="https://github.com/adurdin/thiefy-stuff/raw/master/No%20Spiders/ThiefNoSpiders.zip"&gt;from Github&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://mega.co.nz/#!7UFRmB6C!M_Ct7Sn-DSUIqLKay9do92RpGJo8jE6sG8ZPRJ4rOqg"&gt;from Mega&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/6bjytr7lmbmv46m/ThiefNoSpiders.zip"&gt;from Mediafire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve remade the No Spiders patches using the new &amp;ldquo;dbmod&amp;rdquo; feature of NewDark. What does this mean? Well it&amp;rsquo;s easier to install, won&amp;rsquo;t clash with future updates to Thief, and will probably even work for spiders in fan missions! Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="164689541212" url="https://backslashn.com/post/164689541212" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/164689541212/so-it-was-when-mermoz-made-the-first-seaplane" type="regular" date-gmt="2017-08-27 23:14:17 GMT" date="Mon, 28 Aug 2017 00:14:17" unix-timestamp="1503875657" format="markdown" reblog-key="D75SBNmk" slug="so-it-was-when-mermoz-made-the-first-seaplane" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-body>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So it was when Mermoz made the first seaplane crossing of the South Atlantic. As the daylight was dying, he came into the Doldrums. Moment by moment he watched as the tornadoes tied their tails together before him, as if a wall were taking shape. Then darkness fell, drawing a curtain on this prologue. When he slipped below the clouds an hour later, he entered a fantastical kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Waterspouts stood in apparently motionless ranks like the pillars of a temple. On their swollen capitals rested the dark and lowering arch of the storm, but blades of light sliced down through the cracks in the arch, and between the pillars the full moon gleamed on the cold stone tiles of the sea. And Mermoz made his way through those empty ruins, banking for four hours from one channel of light to another, circling round those giant pillars with the sea surely surging up inside them, following those flows of moonlight towards the exit from the temple. And this spectacle was so overwhelming that Mermoz, once through the Doldrums, realized that he had not been afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So here&amp;rsquo;s a few thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed it up until the final couple of levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controls took a little getting used to at first, but I quickly became accustomed to ASDX(WJ) for tank-like first-person movement with my left hand, while my right-hand stayed on the mouse for interactions. I avoided using the interaction mode icons for the most part (except for combat), and instead used right-click to look and right-drag to pick up/talk to/use. Got into the swing of things by the end of the first hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was interesting to note that the default controls in Thief: The Dark Project&amp;ndash;S to walk, W to run, X to walk backwards, right click to use a highlighted item&amp;ndash;that always seemed weird to someone used to WASD have their legacy in this game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked exploring. Having the map only reveal areas I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, and even then only geometry, but allowing me to add my own notes to the map for things important to me… I felt much more involved in discovering the layout of the dungeon and in keeping track of quests than with the current paradigm in (for example) Horizon: Zero Dawn, where icons are shown on the map for everything you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered (whether still relevant or not) and for anything you&amp;rsquo;ve been told about or half-revealed by climbing a Tall-Neck. Actively being involved in the cartography makes it much more valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the game has no quest logs or conversation logs, I kept notes manually on a pad of paper as I played, roughly one page per level, crossing off tasks as I did them. This was fine at a desk, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work half so well if I was sitting on a sofa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some NPCs allow you to repeat their conversation trees ad infitum; others will never repeat important information they&amp;rsquo;ve said. Taking accurate notes as you play is essential to completing the game without resorting to the hint book or walkthroughs. I summarized heavily in my notes, and in a couple of cases this led to me omitting words that turned out to be crucial. Thankfully I had walkthroughs to fall back on when this happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping in this game is terrible. The platforming puzzles start on the very first level, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the last few hours of the game that I felt I&amp;rsquo;d got the knack of it, and could jump over chasms successfully most of the time. The trick is not to jump while walking or running (except for really long jumps); but to press S (or W) then immediately press J and hold it for a quarter of a second. But always save before a hazardous jump just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the awkwardness of the controls for jumping, it is great that it is possible. There&amp;rsquo;s so much more room for exploration in a level when it can have unexpected paths in the third dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to throw objects with physical simulation (they even bounce off the walls and the floor) would have been very novel in 1992. But with one exception in a side quest, it is never important in the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, the physical simulation for missile weapons and projectile spells is awful. Having to lead my shots is just terrible when the enemies don&amp;rsquo;t move with any inertia. Trying to hit anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t standing still is tough. This, together with the short view distance and the need to carry around ammunition meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with missile weapons or spells in the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of a functioning economy in the game is great. It frees my from my packrat tendencies whereby I feel compelled in most RPGs to carry as much shite as I can in order to sell it back to a merchant. Typically doing this means I accumulate way more currency than I actually need, but I still feel compelled regardless. But the weirdness and opaqueness of the bartering system in &lt;em&gt;Underworld&lt;/em&gt; means I quickly couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered. And there was very rarely anything I wanted available to barter anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistence of the world state is great. I had to keep my inventory down to essentials due to weight, so it was very helpful being able to drop the I-don&amp;rsquo;t-need-this-right-now-but-it-looks-important items in familiar places and come back to them later. Also the fact that monsters didn&amp;rsquo;t respawn made the backtracking much less tedious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are still a few too many mazes in the level design. &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/44238785850/system-shock-2-verisimilitude"&gt;You know how much I love mazes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: additional thoughts on magic:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The magic system is neat. There are 25 magic runes, and spells are made up of two or three of these runes. To ready a spell, you open your rune bag, select the runes for it (e.g. V, K, and C runes for the VAS KAL CORP spell), which puts the runes onto the little shelf below the viewport. Then to cast the spell at any time, you just click on the prepared runes, consuming mana according to the strength of the spell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The available spells are grouped into eight circles, and you can&amp;rsquo;t cast spells from higher circles until you have leveled up enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to that, you start the game with only a few of the rune stones, and have to find others in the underworld in order to be able to cast additional spells. Each new rune opens up several additional spells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spells are a proto-linguistic system (as in all Ultima games since 5), where each rune&amp;rsquo;s name has a specific meaning. So when I finally found the F (FLAM) rune, it opened up a number of fire-based spells (fireball, resist fire, wall of flame) that had previously been impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The V (VAS) rune means &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo;, and is a key part of many higher level spells. Rather than just finding this rune at random in the dungeon, there&amp;rsquo;s actually a side quest with a puzzle to solve to obtain it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a number of spells that aren&amp;rsquo;t listed in the manual that you can discover&amp;ndash;either by trial and error (and the meanings in the rune names means this won&amp;rsquo;t be just random) or by being told about them by NPCs or reading about them in scattered notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit frustrating to only have one prepared spell at a single time though. Can&amp;rsquo;t easily cast fireball and heal in the middle of a fight without fumbling through the rune bag while dodging enemy attacks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The pleasure of experiencing architecture is both a direct sensory pleasure grounded in embodiment and a considered intellectual pleasure. An intellectual pleasure relies on interpretation and understanding, and if we do not understand we miss much of the enjoyment (a reason, of course, why enthusiasts in any field get far more enjoyment out of the objects of their attention than do outsiders). An analysis opens up the way to an interpretation that seeks to contribute to understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Understanding is not only for pleasure. Any discipline thrives on critical reflection, discussion and debate about its products. The past provides patterns and precedents for future work, and understanding the past helps to make a better future. This transcends the transition from traditional to digital media in design during the sixty years that separate the earliest and most recent buildings in this book. Indeed digital design media facilitate the adaptation of successful design patterns from the past as well as the exploration of new form.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Analyses offer the means to learn about the &amp;lsquo;how&amp;rsquo; of buildings: how details relate to one another; how a building relates to its urban or rural setting, to its climate and to the society it serves; how materials are used. An analysis can address 'why&amp;rsquo; questions through interpretation: why a building takes a particular form, why certain materials are selected and why a precedent is referred to in a design.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The analyses in this book aim to offer interpretations akin to those of reviewers or critics, with no claim that we have access to the minds of the architects. Finnish architect and theorist Juhani Pallasmaa emphasizes that the role of responsible architectural criticism is to create and defend the 'sense of the real&amp;rsquo; in a world that is 'increasingly fictionalized by an architecture of the commercialized image&amp;rsquo;. As critics, the analysers observe, read the available literature (certainly including the words of the architects where published) and present their interpretation of the work. This is particularly significant for the 'why&amp;rsquo; questions. In some cases architects have described how building form arose during design, while in other cases there is little information about the reasoning behind the building.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;As in a review of a book, film or restaurant, the credibility of the analysis depends on it being sufficiently complete to tell a coherent story true to the sense of the real, and on that story being thought-provoking to a reader, encouraging new interpretations. Like a review, too, the aim of these analyses is to offer selected insights that have value, not to exhaustively cover every aspect. The analysis of a work of architecture should prompt readers to look for further ways to analyse the building, and even to disagree with the interpretations of the authors. Because the projects selected here are generally well known, readers are likely to come to them with preconceptions that may or may not be challenged. We want to prompt new interpretations, and a questioning of old interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She was working on the budget, the shooting schedule, arrangements for transport and accommodation, and reviewing hundreds of photos from a location scout. She was switching between four or five different apps, each suited to a different kind of data. And all the files for this project were organised under a folder for this project, which sat alongside folders for several other projects she is also working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These to me are essentials of a pro computing environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Esther reduced the form of the FPS to almost nothing: removing objectives, enemies, and all gameplay challenges, it keeps only three elements from the FPS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first-person viewpoint&lt;/strong&gt;, where I control the camera. In an FPS, player-controlled camera movement is almost exclusively tied to my decision where to shoot; when the designer wants you to look, most take over control of the camera to force my attention. In &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt;, except in the immediate beginning and end, the camera remains in my control, but sans weapons it now belongs to my decision where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking along a linear path&lt;/strong&gt; is the main way to progress. In an FPS, this progression is typically through a series of combat encounters of increasing difficulty; without combat, &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; turns this movement into progressive revelation of its narration. As in most linear FPSes, &lt;em&gt;Esther’s&lt;/em&gt; levels include a side paths that branch off the main path, but which are loops or dead ends, not an alternative route to the level’s end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ubiquitous “dude-in-ear”,&lt;/strong&gt; the disembodied voice that in far too many FPSes is my guide to the next objective or the next plot twist. &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; uses this voice for narration, a single voice relating fragmentary, muddied scraps of several interwoven tales. Importantly, and unlike most FPSes, in &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; this voice is often in first person, suggesting an identification (however uncertain) between the voice and the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt; is the synthesis of these three elements into a singular experience of discovering a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk up the cliffside path, around the corner; I see a bothy ahead; the narrator begins to relate how the old shepherd used to dwell in the bothy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I clamber clumsily down some rocks; there is a sharp crack as I reach the bottom; the voice describes the writer’s path down the same rocks, and his fractured ankle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk through the dark caves; the narrator begins talking about Paul’s car accident; I see ahead a wrecked car in the caves, impossibly, its headlights still on and shining up to the cave roof in parallel white lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the tales that the narrator tells—of the shepherd, of the writer Donovan, of Paul and the car accident—are murky and interwoven; their identities shift, the events that happen to one becoming described later from another’s point of view. Did Paul travel to the island, or only Donovan? &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; never attempts to answer such questions, and for a player to do so would be to miss the point: in &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt; I am discovering or experiencing an emotionally disturbed, possibly intoxicated, possibly hallucinating mind; it is easiest to latch onto Paul as the identity of the narrator, as the most real identity—or at least the most similar to myself: a white-collar worker, probably, commuting on the motorway. And yet the events the narrator describes as having happened to him personally are contradictory, even anachronistic. And the whole is further confused by the chemical, electrical, and biblical symbolism spread throughout the levels. Is Paul the driver? Or is Paul the apostle, suffering an epiphany on the road to Damascus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t go further into the narrative of &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt; here, but if you’re interested you can &lt;a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/dear-esther"&gt;download and play it&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps read &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/05/15/touched-by-the-hand-of-mod-dear-esther/"&gt;Lewis Denby’s piece on it&lt;/a&gt;. What I want to convey with the description above is the how the minimal gameplay elements connect intimately with events and descriptions in the narrative, and how the confused, allusive narrative is reflected in the irreal and symbolic elements in the game’s levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt; is a backwards step from &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt;, as it keeps the same formal elements of walking, looking, and discovering fragmented pieces of a narrative, but loses the interconnection between these that makes &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; so effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Rapture&lt;/em&gt;, I am exploring a small English country town in a valley, where everyone is missing. I can explore the town at my leisure, looking through the houses and sheds, the doctor&amp;rsquo;s surgery and the pub. In places, ghosts formed of coruscating light appear as I approach&amp;ndash;the echoes of two or three former inhabitants&amp;ndash;and in a short vignette reenact a conversation between them. The telephones in the town are each ringing as I approach, and I overhear additional snippets of past conversations when I investigate them. Portable radios can also be found, which somehow broadcast the thoughts of the astronomer Kate, as though she had recorded her thoughts aloud onto tape. Finally, glowing balls of light around the village provide additional vignettes, but these only begin to play after I “tune” the ball of light in to a point by tilting the PS4 controller.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rapture’s&lt;/em&gt; elements are similar at first glance to &lt;em&gt;Esther’s&lt;/em&gt;, but with notable differences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A use button&lt;/strong&gt; complicates the meaning of my camera movement. I am still mostly looking at the world, but also looking at specific objects to try to activate them. The camera is no longer an instrument of inspection, but also of action. Doors, radios, telephones, televisions, and more objects can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or some of them can be used: the distinction between usable objects and unusable objects is often uncertain: many usable doors and gates are signified by being ajar; but some fully closed doors can be used and others cannot, and a few gates that are ajar cannot be opened. Worse still, some doors are initially closed and unusable when first encountered, but later become opened after events are triggered elsewhere. Telephones and radios are less problematic because when usable, they draw my attention by repeating a ringing or radio static sound.[4] This is not unique to &lt;em&gt;Rapture&lt;/em&gt;, but is a common failing in contemporary high budget games, where the ability to present highly detailed environments has outpaced the appetite for making those environments interactive.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The levels are no longer linear&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Rapture&lt;/em&gt;, for the most part. I can wander around the valley and into its houses as I please. Even between the different loosely bounded chapters—each centering on both a key character and a different area of the valley—there is usually the main path connecting them along the road and another, less obvious, path through the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progression through the narrative is still directed, if not constrained. You don’t need to find every fragment to reach the end—there is even a trophy for reaching the game’s end without finding the end of each of the other key characters’ storylines—but it is unclear to me just how much is gated off at the beginning. Take for example the church in the first area: its rear doors lead out to a path up the hillside to the next area, but they are initially closed and I cannot open them, but at the conclusion of the storyline of Jeremy the priest, the doors open and lights lead me out and up the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious downside to my freedom to roam is that I can bypass parts of the village entirely, and so miss out on the ghost vignettes that take place there. To counteract this, the game has a floating, glowing entity that moves around of its own accord; when approached, it reacts to my presence and then leads me in the direction of the nearest undiscovered vignette.[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so generic. &lt;em&gt;Rapture&lt;/em&gt; falls down in comparison to &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt; in the way its narrative relates to the game and to me, the player. &lt;strong&gt;Narrative fragments are embodied and identifiable.&lt;/strong&gt; They are revealed in these vignettes, where each voice belongs to a single, distinct character, whose ghost replays moments of their last days in the streets and buildings that they inhabited. They are literal characters in a literal place. There is no longer the confusion between player and narrator, the island and the mind that was so essential to &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt;; instead the ghosts simply reveal a story that happened in the past, in which I am not involved and have no power to affect. I am reduced to simply a detached observer, just as in so many other games that scatter audio logs through their levels in lieu of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture,&lt;/em&gt; The Chinese Room demonstrates that they have the technical and artistic ability to create an attractive, open game world. But they failed to approach its design for interactivity with the same care that is apparent in &lt;em&gt;Esther&lt;/em&gt;, instead borrowing from contemporary FPSes conventions that while common were only ever band-aid solutions to deeper intrinsic problems. The result is a game that feels ungainly, incoherent, always a little at odds with itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;em&gt;Dear Esther&lt;/em&gt; was originally released in 2009 in the form of a mod for &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;, and can still be downloaded free of charge. It was remade a few years later, and released commercially &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/203810"&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. I talk in this piece to the mod, as its relative lack of complexity makes it, I believe, a more cohesive unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;em&gt;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture&lt;/em&gt; was released in 2015 for PS4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] The significance of the automatically playing vignettes versus those triggered by “tuning” is uncertain to me, with one exception: some “tuning” actions occur at the end of one of the central character’s storylines, and these are distinguished by needing to hold the “tuning point” for longer, and by the trail of glowing lights after the end of the vignette that leads to the beginning of the next central character’s storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4] In the final section of the game, five crucial audio logs left by Kate can be heard from reel-to-reel tape recorders, which have not been seen heretofore, and as with all other usable objects in the game are not visually distinguished as such. I nearly missed them all, only trying the fourth one out of finding nothing else to do in its location, and being surprised that it was usable. Frustratingly, a sixth identical tape recorder occurs in the very last location, yet it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5] A first paradoxical question arises from this: if you have designed a highly detailed environment, yet I can interact with little of it, how can I find the interactive parts among the clutter? It is common for contemporary FPSes to overcome this problem by visually highlighting usable objects in a HUD, or by flashing them, or in a separate visual mode that ironically draws only the usable objects. &lt;em&gt;Rapture&lt;/em&gt; does none of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[6] This is &lt;em&gt;Rapture’s&lt;/em&gt; version of the objective markers that afflict most open world games, its solution to a second paradoxical question: if you have given me an open world and freedom to roam, how do you guide me to the only points of interest you designed in it?&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>gamedesign</tag><tag>thechineseroom</tag></post><post id="121935238877" url="https://backslashn.com/post/121935238877" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/121935238877/something-in-the-landscape-has-just-cracked" type="regular" date-gmt="2015-06-19 18:16:33 GMT" date="Fri, 19 Jun 2015 19:16:33" unix-timestamp="1434737793" format="markdown" reblog-key="Q1PAcK23" slug="something-in-the-landscape-has-just-cracked" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Something in the landscape has just cracked apart, as a log that seemed burnt out suddenly crackles and launches a spray of sparks. By what mystery did the whole plain move in one instant? Trees release their seeds when spring comes. Why this abrupt springtime of weapons? Why this luminous deluge rising towards us, suddenly universal?

&amp;gt; My first feeling is that I have been careless. I have ruined everything. Sometimes a gesture or a wink is all it takes, when the balance is too precarious! A mountaineer coughs, and an avalanche is unleashed. Once he has unleashed it, all is over.

&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by Lt G. W. Dallison.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A whole nation of jugglers has just joined the dance. A nation of jugglers flicking their missiles out towards us in tens of thousands. With no angular variation in their flight, these appear motionless at first, but like those coloured balls which the juggler’s skill seems to release rather than hurl into the air, they are beginning their slow ascent. I see teardrops of light flowing towards me through an oil of silence. Steeped in the silence of a juggler’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Every machine-gun or rapid-fire cannon burst is delivering hundreds of shells or phosphorescent bullets, following one another into the sky like the beads of a rosary. A thousand elastic rosaries are stretching toward us, elongated to breaking point, and then they snap at our height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Seen laterally, the missiles that have missed us are in fact moving tangentially at a vertiginous speed. The teardrops are now lightning bolts, and I find myself drowning in a harvest of luminous pathways, all with the colour of wheat stalks. I am in the centre of a dense thicket of spear-thrusts. I am threatened by a vortex of needles. The whole plain has me in its mesh, and is weaving around me a coruscating network of golden wires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1892" data-orig-width="2469" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/FdFlQjK.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="max-width: 100%" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/836ae50cbdde16b12ad73297f73f5f2b/tumblr_inline_pk3mffudow1qzlvtz_540.jpg" alt="A long exposure of anti-aircraft fire looks like thick bundles of bright lines in the sky." data-orig-height="1892" data-orig-width="2469" data-orig-src="https://i.imgur.com/FdFlQjK.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;French anti-aircraft fire during a Nazi raid on Algiers, 1943. Photo by Lt. W. R. Wilson.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Yet when I look down towards the ground I find once more those layers of shining bubbles, rising with the slowness of veils of mist. I find that slow whirling of seeds, rising into the air like the husks of threshed grain. But at eye-level, I see only sheaves of spears! Guns firing? No! I am being attacked with cold steel, I see only swords of light! I feel &amp;hellip; no, not in danger! Dazzled by this luxury in which I am steeped.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier that KQIV was the first game my family ever bought for our home computer. As would become a tradition, my mom controlled the keyboard, with me and my brothers crowded around the computer desk watching. With all the visual flash of the introduction, it was an incredibly exciting moment!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;And then it took us half an hour to figure out how to move. We were all “WALK NORTH” and it just went “this game does not understand north.” We scoured the manual for hints. Somewhere it said something like “If you get stuck, remember, leave no stone unturned!” But sadly, typing “TURN STONE” didn’t help at all. It was an embarrassingly long time before we realized the arrow keys had anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I try to keep this little parable in mind if I ever think that videogame controls are in any way accessible to people who haven’t played videogames their entire lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Multiple solutions falling out of our simulation didn’t happen as often as we’d hoped. We just didn’t have a deep enough simulation nor did we have the time or personnel to create one. We found ourselves in the position of having to brute-force the multiple-path idea, as developers on Ultima games, for example, have done for years — though I think we do more of it, more consciously and more effectively, than anyone else has to date. Designers have had to plan a “skill” path past problems, an “action” path and a “character interaction” path. It works, but it’s not what we originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad that I can&amp;rsquo;t play the game, but it makes parts of it really hard. For a friend of mine, it&amp;rsquo;s even worse: he can&amp;rsquo;t bear to play the first Thief at all because of all the spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch makes all the spiders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friendly to the player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attacked by other AI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have only one hit point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die as soon as the level starts anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look like a small white mossy stone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invisible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teleported out of the level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big spiders, small spiders, chaos spiders, spiderbots: all are either completely gone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter is of course the same issue that has been discussed endlessly regarding the killing of representations of people in shooting games. In most shooters, the representations of both the avatar and the cannon fodder are equally shallow; which is why treating only the one seriously enough to &lt;a href="http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/05/06/matter-of-perspective-nathan-drake-from-treasure-hunter-to-mass-murderer/"&gt;call Nathan Drake a “mass murderer”&lt;/a&gt; sounds dissonant and just a little ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dissonance was recognised in &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/"&gt;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think there’s a problem, a serious problem, with using “depression” as a “play mechanic,” as a convenient means to an end. I do think using “depression” is cavalier, that it really does diminish a clinical health problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;You write that “mechanics are often the best tool for representing complex emotional concepts,” and I agree, wholeheartedly. But here you’re literally saying that mechanics can add up to an economical explanation of a complicated concept. That is not the same thing as using a complicated concept, like “depression,” to explain a game mechanic: it’s the literal opposite. It makes zero sense. It’s like saying “I can use a lot of mechanics to explain what it’s like to live with cancer” — sure, a talented game designer can build that intricate system, can make that experience real for a player — but that is not the same thing as “I can win a battle by using My Cancer!”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I started out by saying you’d written a great explanation, and I mean that. The thought processes themselves are totally valid, and the game is really really clever and often very funny. I think the people who have seemingly antagonized ICC throughout the day are, by and large, totally aware that this was a creative endeavor executed all in good fun and good faith. I also think the game is, not too frequently but enough that some people have noticed, tone-deaf at times.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But I also think — and this goes back to the “depression” point — games always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; become problematic when we use intricate concepts to explain comparatively simple play mechanics (as opposed to going in the other direction, which you say was your intent). Braid, for instance, goes in the other direction. It is, if arguably, a game that layers simple mechanics to eventually explain a more complex philosophy about the permanence and impermanence of decision-making, about the passage of time. People admire it because the mechanics support the larger idea. (This is why, in ‘Indie Game: the Movie’, Jon Blow complains about Soulja Boy’s cursory interpretation, I think.)&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But any time you try to force complex ideas into supporting a game’s &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt; — and people, individual human beings, are each one a very, very complex “idea,” if you will — it becomes so reductive, so misrepresentative, that yes, any argument in those mechanics’ favor invariably becomes “problematic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is written specifically in response to &lt;a href="http://shigi.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/my-response-to-the-indie-cube-comments/"&gt;Laura Shigihara’s post&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://shigi.wordpress.com/2013/10/23/indie-game-dev-themed-magic-cube-set/"&gt;“Indie Custom Cube” card set&lt;/a&gt;, so please do read that for the full context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am quoting her for the broader principle of design of game mechanics that she describes: &lt;em&gt;if you have game mechanics designed to represent something real, the simplicity or complexity of your mechanics should align with the simplicity or complexity of the real thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if that’s always a good principle to follow, but it’s easy to see that its inverses have issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complex game mechanics to represent a simple real thing will feel overwrought and probably tedious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple game mechanics to represent a complex real thing will feel ‘unrealistic’ and unsatisfying.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7f834126759ac2c60ffaab15a107b65e/tumblr_inline_mupmff4NZQ1qzlvtz.jpg" alt="The CastAR prototype augmented reality glasses are a lightweight glasses frame with twin micro projectors, shutter lenses, and a tracking camera."/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three things bother me about this project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unfocused. They’re throwing everything but the kitchen sink into what this will do: projected AR, true AR (to use their term), and VR. Oh, and the odd wand input device. Oh, and the RFID-sensing mat which appears to be entirely unrelated (though perhaps a useful adjunct for many purposes). I get the feeling that their product will be mediocre at all of these instead of really good at one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re suspiciously quiet on the true AR and VR performance. They talk up how the projected AR is comfortable on the eyes due to normal focusing distances, and doesn’t need adjustment for individual users. But they fail to mention how their true AR and VR clip-on solution will require both of these. They don’t address the technical or user experience details of this at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don’t talk at all about cabling for signal and power. Their pictures of their current prototype also hide these details which are an essential component of the user experience. This makes me worry that they’ve not thought about this aspect of it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I’m not backing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My new Nokia telephone model is called the E 51. Unfortunately the phone has not been designed in so that just anybody could learn to use it easily.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;On the contrary, I think that it has been designed as if its most important mission would be to advertise itself to people who are interested in telephone technology. All kinds of amazing functions are offered on the display, but as I do not understand what they mean, I guess that I will never use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most concise statement I’ve seen of a longstanding problem in technology product designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does your device/app/website/game look?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/896cde47d77c024c82a4a5f7d3f98b30/tumblr_inline_mshzpnp6dw1qz4rgp.jpg" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The picture shows another player, kneeling on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him; Rocket’s caption is “It worked! finally&amp;hellip; As yes, I am working on more important things. This was just for fun.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got my attention and interest in DayZ back up again like no other news about the DayZ standalone. Why? Well, here’s the other things that we know Rocket and his team have been building into the standalone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network architecture changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centrally controlled loot economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loot spawning under beds, on top of shelves, in car boots, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved inventory system and user interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More enterable buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New areas of Chernarus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water purification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infections and transmissible disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customisable player clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first six of these are about security, usability, and polish. They will make it more accessible, and perhaps make exploration more interesting, but none of them will change the way people play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water purification and infections add an additional burden of micromanagement-of-the-self. I feel that these will just force players into scavenging for purification tablets and medicines in towns just as they already have to scavenge for food and water. They add two more dimensions to the player’s needs, but they’re only fulfilled by scavenged resources. In contrast, the existing food and water systems in DayZ are already slightly differentiated: players can collect drinks and food by scavenging in towns, but water can also be collected from the lakes scattered across the country, and food can be found by hunting animals. Towns force players to face zombie threats; lakes are few, and so are a common place to encounter other players; hunting usually requires shooting, which alerts nearby players. As a result, there are tactical implications (however small) to the manner in which a player chooses to fulfill these needs. I don’t see that water purification or infections will add useful variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmissible diseases might, but I’m doubtful. Obviously players will want to avoid disease. If there are clear indications that a hostile player is diseased, it simply adds another reason to shoot them. If it’s a friendly player, do you go find medicine? Or do you shoot them anyway and look after their gear for when they respawn and make their way back?  On the other hand, if the symptoms of disease are not immediately obvious, players will be frustrated by ending up infected without knowing how or why. Invisible systems are rarely good game design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customisable player clothing is the first interesting new feature—that is, the first with a clear value to players and effect on how they play. More than just personal expression, being able to recognise other members of your team visually can literally be the difference between life and death (and is partly why the removal of “bandit skins” was so detrimental to the game). It also adds the possibility of subterfuge: if you know that a group identifies by wearing the same item of clothing, if you wear the same, you may be able to confuse them long enough to gain the upper hand in an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my measure for whether a change to DayZ is good or bad—and this is of course, like, just my opinon, man—is by the impact it has on player interaction. I deplore the tendency towards shoot on sight that developed in the game, so a rule that allows a broader range of interactions is good. An example might be NPC-policed safe zones (not that they’re on the table for DayZ), where attacking another player guarantees an overwhelming (but not invincible) retaliation. And this handcuffing feature falls right into the same category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handcuffing allows one player to guarantee another’s inability to harm them, for a limited amount of time (players can struggle free from the handcuffs eventually). It means surrender could become a viable option in fights. It means players can take prisoners, which has interesting implications for inter-group relations and prisoner exchanges. It means that finally there is a way to impose conditions on other players that’s less lethal than a bullet to the head. It won’t in any way obviate the interplay of trust and betrayal (that made DayZ so interesting in its early days), but gives players a new and interesting tool to use when trust is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m really excited to see the handcuffing feature; but seeing Rocket call it “just for fun” and that he’s “working on more important things” leaves me worried that the standalone DayZ won’t be the game that the mod promised so early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; The &lt;a href="http://dayzdev.tumblr.com/post/60493075597/another-video-devblog-the-showcase-this-time-is"&gt;latest devblog&lt;/a&gt; shows this handcuffing in action. Rocket also demonstrates in some detail how item degradation works, and in particular how shooting another player can damage or even destroy the items they are carrying. He hopes that this, together with the handcuffing, will help address the &amp;ldquo;kill on sight mentality&amp;rdquo;. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>dayz</tag><tag>game design</tag><tag>games</tag></post><post id="53222114645" url="https://backslashn.com/post/53222114645" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/53222114645/thief-rebooted-not-respected" type="regular" date-gmt="2013-06-17 21:03:09 GMT" date="Mon, 17 Jun 2013 22:03:09" unix-timestamp="1371502989" format="markdown" reblog-key="DPg0va7P" slug="thief-rebooted-not-respected" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Thief: Rebooted, Not Respected</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My Experience: I’m all for reboots and reinventions breaking outside the box. In fact, I encourage it. If I wanted to play old-school Thief, I’d just play old-school Thief.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;That said, goodness gracious great balls of fire, what were so many great balls of fire doing in my Thief game? The scene I played saw the mansion collapsing, with rivulets of fire slithering across my path while larger conflagrations mushroomed up all around. The obvious objective? Run for your life. Run or die. Run run run run run run.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This section was essentially on rails, and sneaking wasn’t even a factor. I dashed over burning bridges, stumbled across collapsing rooftops, and watched entire sections of mansion crumble into the tar-black waters below in sloooooow mooootion. Trial-and-error came fast and furious, with various sections nearly requiring death and a subsequent restart before making sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There was also a fair amount of third-person during this section. I didn’t hate it or anything, but any sort of climbing basically was Assassin’s Creed – right down to little animation details like the way Garrett swung his leg to build momentum before bigger leaps. Far more egregious, meanwhile, was an insta-death QTE involving a loose chunk of wall and a quick button-mash to give Garrett’s grappling line a life-saving toss. I mean, really? In Thief? Why? Why at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That a scripted action sequence like this was even considered for a Thief game, let alone made it into the press demo (and almost certainly the final game)… this makes me very sad.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="47697714345" url="https://backslashn.com/post/47697714345" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/47697714345/the-invisible-elizabeth" type="regular" date-gmt="2013-04-11 12:57:00 GMT" date="Thu, 11 Apr 2013 13:57:00" unix-timestamp="1365685020" format="markdown" reblog-key="SSYVkjdl" slug="the-invisible-elizabeth" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>The Invisible Elizabeth</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;The player in Bioshock Infinite interacts with the game in three roles: passively observing first-person cutscenes; explorating the environment and collecting loot (money, ammunition, audio diaries, etc.); and combat. As a shooter, the majority of the player’s time is spent in combat, followed by exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Elizabeth’s role, when considered in the light of the mechanics the player operates under in both exploration and combat is inconsequential nearly to the point of invisibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the player is exploring, Elizabeth moves around constantly. If the player is standing still or walking around a small area, Elizabeth will sit down, or wander around peering closely at things, or dance a few steps—animations for “boredom”, I guess you could say. When the player starts moving with purpose, Elizabeth will sometimes run ahead, or sometimes fall behind; she doesn’t call for the player to catch up or to wait for her, but just tags along, undemanding. In these states, the game offers no incentive nor pressure to interact with Elizabeth, nor in fact any way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunities for interaction with Elizabeth feel artificial and mechanical. From time to time, Elizabeth will call out when she has spotted a lockpick or audio diary. When the player is collecting or spending money, Elizabeth will sometimes offer some money that she has supposedly gathered from the environment (but is in fact spawned for the occasion). That these offers always follow immediately after the player’s actions adds to the artificiality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/c157485a61750ff66a7ffd754e0ecc32/tumblr_inline_ml3db0X7Bi1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="Booker catches a coin that Elizabeth tosses towards him"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth also has the role of deciphering the two or three codes and picking the many locked doors that separate the player from the next area or a small side area with special loot. It is odd that while only Elizabeth can pick locks, and notices lockpicks in the environment, the player is required to pick them up, and has a HUD display to indicate how many lockpicks they have, and how many the door requires. In consequence, the rules of this system are more visible than Elizabeth’s part, and the resource management more important. The player doesn’t even have to seek Elizabeth out and ask her to pick the lock for him: merely looking at the lock and pressing a button makes Elizabeth come tripping up, pick the lock, and a few seconds later waltz off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is notably different from the system &lt;a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/6/4067832/the-meaningful-murder-in-bioshock-infinite"&gt;Ken Levine described to Polygon&lt;/a&gt; not long before release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have all of these systems that after you are in combat and you ask her to, like pick a lock or something she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be like, ‘OK, Booker.&amp;rsquo; She actually cools. Her emotions cool down over time because you have a lot of dissonant moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appear to be no such systems in the game, but instead two or three scripted sequences where Elizabeth confronts Booker about his violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During combat, Elizabeth’s role is much the same: she sometimes offers the player salts, or a health pack if he’s running low on either. She will occasionally call out to alert the player to a new enemy; but it’s not as if the player has to look at her and see where she’s pointing (a very human kind of interaction)—instead the enemy is automatically highlighted on the player&amp;rsquo;s screen so as to be immediately visible even through any objects that are between it and the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central element of the narrative in &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is that Elizabeth has a unique talent of manipulating “tears”, wormhole-like rifts that connect parallel universes. But in the exploration and combat roles, the mechanics again belie this, both for the few tears that you encounter while exploring, and the many weapon stashes, turrets, oil spills, and so on that can be summoned in combat arenas. To open one of these years, the player looks at it and pushes a button, and it appears. Elizabeth says a line of dialogue in response to this, but is not involved in the mechanics of it. She does not even have to be near an object to summon it, unlike the narrative depiction of all the tears in cutscenes. Nor does the player does not have to be concerned about her emotional state or fatigue, as the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEBwKO4RFOU"&gt;E3 2011 preview promised&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a real missed opportunity here to design the player’s interaction in such a way to present Elizabeth as a human character, and to reflect the codependent relationship that the narrative insists that she and Booker share. But instead, the systems the player interacts with are simplistic and transparent resource management or powerup activation problems, with Elizabeth’s character shoehorned in between a button press and its action.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>game design</tag><tag>bioshock infinite</tag></post><post id="47653083251" url="https://backslashn.com/post/47653083251" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/47653083251/80-word-review-bioshock-infinite" type="regular" date-gmt="2013-04-10 22:55:00 GMT" date="Wed, 10 Apr 2013 23:55:00" unix-timestamp="1365634500" format="markdown" reblog-key="pZELXTqz" slug="80-word-review-bioshock-infinite" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>80 word review: Bioshock Infinite</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;The flying city of Columbia is rendered in bright, loud colours.

The original games are very close to my heart, so I&amp;rsquo;m naturally wary of any changes to what I consider to be the core elements of &lt;em&gt;Thief: The Dark Project&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Thief II: The Metal Age&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; is a game about being exposed and vulnerable in the light, and impossibly powerful in the dark; and the delicious tension of the inbetween. It&amp;rsquo;s about the world of sound: fearing the loudness of your own movements; dreading the approaching footsteps of an enemy; wondering which corner is hiding that whistling guard. It&amp;rsquo;s about freedom of movement, of choosing your route through a level, of climbing over walls and jumping onto balconies, of finding your own shortcuts through the third dimension with rope arrows. It&amp;rsquo;s about dousing torches to bring shadows, mossing floors for silence, blackjacking guards and dumping them in dark corners to roam unthreatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in a way it&amp;rsquo;s about the paradoxical tension and fusion of magic and technology; and the wrestling for dominance between pagans, hammerites, and keepers; and the cynical, reluctant hero called Garrett in the middle of all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think Eidos&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt; will live up to all of this. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;: Eidos isn&amp;rsquo;t aiming to build these same systems again, but are developing their own design that resembles it in some ways, and diverges in others. But as much as I accept that it won&amp;rsquo;t be the same, I still &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it to be. And so my hopes and fears are whipped up and soothed by the snippets of information that early previews are revealing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The magic formula for designing a great stealth game: Force players into a series of impossible situations and then give them the tools to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Game Informer, April 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ten to fifteen years ago, you&amp;rsquo;d have to watch the guards patrol and wait for a moment to move. If the guards saw you, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really game over, but it was almost like you might as well just press the reset button. The big difference today is that players don&amp;rsquo;t want to play the same sections over and over again. Our job is really to make it so that when you are seen you have options to move through or stumble the guards and then jump back in the shadows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re trying to find a balance between making combat enjoyable and allowing you to enter into combat if you want, but at the same time not letting you completely clear a room that way. … We want you to play as a thief, but we don&amp;rsquo;t want to force you to play as a thief. You can play the game aggressively if you want, but it won&amp;rsquo;t be as easy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It just seems a terrible shame that the slang and accents that ran through The City as strongly as mortar and water are perhaps being dismissed as something allusive and on the level of footnote or in-joke. The language of Thief was as much a part of the atmosphere of the place, its credibility and otherworldiness, as the skyline or the shadow. To hear guards swear is not only crude in a linguistic sense, I find it confounding and it causes the sense of place, so immaculately crafted, to creak at the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/04/04/first-look-thief/"&gt;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful, extraordinary place, this city, but is it recognisable as a version of The City? The weirdness, that not-quite steampunk ahistorical off-kilter sensibility, was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you like taking people out and looting at your leisure, that&amp;rsquo;s an option. If you like massive fights, go for it. And if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and your preferred approach to stealth games is &amp;lsquo;no touching&amp;rsquo;, you can be a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-04-thief-preview-deadly-shadows-that-move"&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We also get to see new ways of traversing the environment, like a dash ability that lets Garrett move between two adjacent areas of shadow without anyone noticing his movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re right that [sound is] crucial,&amp;rdquo; says producer Stephane Roy. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s really, really, really, really important for us. For of course the ambience but also the type of game. Just imagine the diversity in the 'barks&amp;rsquo; also with the AI - with the next-gen we have the possibility now that the barks will be really connected with the action you do. … Fans of the old Thief franchise will recognise in the demo you saw earlier that there are carpets, and the carpets actually change the way, you know, if you&amp;rsquo;re running you will not make a lot of sound. So this is more for the fans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re navigating narrow beams you will be guided along them automatically and dismounting will require you to press a button. … There will be a mini-map, too … and while there&amp;rsquo;s no cover system, you definitely can lean and you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be concealed when you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, we do have some 3rd person elements – but they’re really kept to a minimum, we don’t have a lot. 3rd person is used to improve your awareness of your surroundings – for example, during vertical navigation. We’re really taking particular care to make sure that we’re not jarring players back-and-forth between cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="http://community.eidosmontreal.com/blogs/Light-Camera-Hey"&gt;Eidos Community Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Will fighting/combat ever be the best choice to take? If you do choose to take that kind of approach you’ll be challenged by both the guards and the environment/level design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Another good example is, now it&amp;rsquo;s really a first-person game. The team did some prototypes with third-person perspective. … What was interesting is that when you&amp;rsquo;re in first you&amp;rsquo;re very intimate and focused and, like, closed-in, and you need to look behind you. And when you&amp;rsquo;re in third, you kind of automatically felt like 'Okay, if I can see me, other people can see me.&amp;rsquo; That was sort of interesting. But at the end of the day it&amp;rsquo;s much more important that player&amp;rsquo;s comfort is actually looked after more than some kind of narrative brainfart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/03/15/the-history-of-thief-39-s-long-walk-out-of-the-shadows.aspx"&gt;Game Informer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/em&gt; was released, I felt a similar wariness. But then the press preview build—containing the opening few areas—was leaked. I got my hands on it, and tried it, and was immediately hooked. It was clearly different from &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex: Invisible War&lt;/em&gt;, but was a wonderful thing in its own right. I spent at least forty hours playing and replaying that &amp;ldquo;unofficial demo&amp;rdquo;. So despite my concerns about &lt;em&gt;Thief&lt;/em&gt;, I hope it will be a great game. I want to get hooked on it the same way. Perhaps a part of it also might be leaked by some enterprising master thief? It would be thematically appropriate at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps, like Garrett hiding in the shadows for the right moment of opportunity, I will just have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>thief</tag><tag>games</tag></post><post id="46864385381" url="https://backslashn.com/post/46864385381" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/46864385381/a-clear-divide" type="regular" date-gmt="2013-04-01 18:29:11 GMT" date="Mon, 01 Apr 2013 19:29:11" unix-timestamp="1364840951" format="markdown" reblog-key="gzWft8Ip" slug="a-clear-divide" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>A clear divide</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;The imbalance between lethal and non-lethal systems in Dishonored:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a clear divide between lethal play and non-lethal play in Dishonored&amp;rsquo;s mechanics. Lethal gameplay has ornately designed mechanics to promote exciting, hilarious, or at least memorable situations. This is where the Deus Ex influence is felt most directly. They&amp;rsquo;ve developed a series of intricately interwoven systems with the express purpose of fostering emergent behaviours. Rats can be summoned to attack guards, or destroy bodies, or be possessed in order to circumvent security systems, that themselves can be hacked, or disabled, or avoided outright. Time can be frozen to do things like cook your grenade and leave it at the feet of a group of enemies, or possess a bodyguard to walk in front of his own bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dishonored&amp;rsquo;s lethal play mechanics have effectively created a chaotic ludic language players can easily express themselves in. This is when the game&amp;rsquo;s at it&amp;rsquo;s most engaging, offering skilled and creative players the means to achieve their goals using absurd Rube Goldberg machines that rarely work—but when they do, the result is incredible, triggering multiple rulesets against one another, and making the player feel like a villainous mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, non-lethal play has an extremely limited, or at least extremely straightforward vocabulary set. The player can blink, choke people out, tranquilise people, and briefly possess rats and guards just to sidestep security systems and locked doors. And that&amp;rsquo;s really about it. There really aren&amp;rsquo;t any proactive sneaking mechanics like the ones explored in the Thief series. You can&amp;rsquo;t take out lights, or throw noisemakers, or put down moss to make your footsteps quieter. Occasionally you might find a bottle to throw as a distraction, but because it takes up both your hands and needs to be manually carried around instead of being placed in your inventory, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a viable option if the guard you need to distract isn&amp;rsquo;t right there.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Compared to the complex web of interactions for lethal play, non-lethal play has mechanics that are much more insulated from having effects that reverberate throughout the system. You knock a guy out to get inside undetected. You possess a guard to go through the security gate. You do thing X to achieve thing Y and the move on to the next part of the level. The idea of chaining rulesets together on ghost runs and non-lethal playthroughs really doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist the way it does when engaging in lethal play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/32cd3875ce66f3cfbfde820fe1625701/tumblr_inline_miy7rtUjKu1qz4rgp.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Shock 2&amp;rsquo;s medical/science deck:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2ff64e991320b18eb4aca75784d4db9/tumblr_inline_miy7s1hDDa1qz4rgp.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually feels like a starship. Gone are the mazelike twisty corridors of System Shock, whose guiding principle seemed to be “fill every available inch of space with meaningless corridors and secret passages”; in their place is a space that feels &lt;em&gt;authentic&lt;/em&gt;, with subsections and hallways, offices and maintenance access, an architecture that merges the needs of the crew with the constraints of a spacefaring vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This authenticity pervades nearly all of the Von Braun. Every room has a purpose, its location and strucutre, and the objects and furniture within it attesting to that purpose. Crew quarters are cramped, with barely room for a bed, a shower, and a digital picture frame on the wall—and naturally, officers get more room and more amenities. Laboratories have worktables with scientific equipment. Security stations watch over the main corridors. Crew dining areas have galleys attached, and the galleys have freezers for food storage. The recreation deck provides facilities for a broad range of recreational activities: sports, cinema, drinking, gambling, and even “sensual stimulation units”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this kind of verisimilitude is not unique to System Shock 2, nor is it entirely absent from the modern crop of games. What makes the level design in System Shock 2 particularly exciting to me is both the pervasiveness of this architectural plausibility, and its openness. You can visit every room, and (after dealing with the minor problems of no power and a blockage in the shaft) every deck. The contents of each room do not mysteriously resemble recurring waist-high cover, neither are the corridors full of unopenable doors (although there are a handful of those), nor are the rooms strung together into a carefully paced sequence, with gates at key moments to prevent you going back. Although there are a few of those too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get at is the levels in System Shock 2 have not been built to fit the game&amp;rsquo;s combat rules. And this has two effects: firstly, the pacing is all over the place. The level designers do control the pacing to some degree by limiting the appearance of enemies to particular decks, and ensuring that you visit the first few decks in a particular sequence. But the pacing on any individual level is very much at the player&amp;rsquo;s control. If they are slow, careful, and methodical, they will hear and see enemies first and they will avoid setting off security alerts and gun turrets. But if the player wants to race through, they will find that they often hit trouble coming the other way (but can run away from that trouble quite often too). So the pacing, and hence the tension, is really just the game feeding the player&amp;rsquo;s style of play back to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second effect is that the combat is all over the place. An encounter with a shotgun mutant in the cramped Fluidics Tunnels in Engineering deck (and yes, those mazelike tunnels are a blight on the rest of the Von Braun) is a very different thing to encountering them in the central atrium of Med/Sci. Room to move, obstacles to take cover behind, and environmental hazards all vary the flavour of a combat encounter. And because the enemies are drawn to sound, you have the potential to encounter them in a wide variety of rooms, even those off their patrol routes. The end result—the intitial experience of encountering System Shock 2&amp;rsquo;s enemies is thus chaotic, unpredictable, and hence very tense (if not sometimes downright panicky). As the player becomes more fluent in the game, this big messy dynamic system becomes a fun system to poke and prod at as you explore and progress the game&amp;rsquo;s plot.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>system shock 2</tag><tag>games</tag><tag>game design</tag></post><post id="44139013774" url="https://backslashn.com/post/44139013774" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/44139013774/system-shock-2-chemicals" type="regular" date-gmt="2013-02-27 13:51:00 GMT" date="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:51:00" unix-timestamp="1361973060" format="markdown" reblog-key="SzvxGe3l" slug="system-shock-2-chemicals" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>System Shock 2: Chemicals</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just played through &lt;a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/system_shock_2"&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. I’ll be writing up some scattered impressions of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get excited when I enter the next room. The sign above the door reads “Chemical Storage” and inside is a shelf piled with jars of chemical elements: molybdenum, cesium, barium, technetium. They are arranged in no particular order, and some are lying on the ground beside the shelf, clearly having fallen off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get excited because these many jars suggest to me that there’s yet another system in this game. There&amp;rsquo;s an adventurous feel about a design that is built of so many systems, as though the designers were still hacking their way through the thick jungle of possibilities, where now most large games simply follow the well-worn paths of familiar, polished mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My excitement is a little premature, as it later turns out. The chemicals do not presage the crafting system I had envisioned, but instead exist as arbitrary roadblocks to the game&amp;rsquo;s research mechanic. When you pick up an unknown artifact—an organ from a mutant’s body, a vial of an unknown formula, or a strange organic implant—you must research it before you can use it. And sadly, this research mechanic is isolated, not part of a system. You right click on the unknown object, then click the “Research” button in your MFD. And then you go on your way; the research proceeds in the background as you go (the MFD’s progress bar indicating, I assume, how many chapters it&amp;rsquo;s written for your doctoral thesis so far). After a while, with a ping, you get a message telling you the MFD needs some chemical or other to continue the research. And so you trundle back to chemical storage, pick up the jar, and right click on it to use it. And that&amp;rsquo;s it—the chemicals’ only function in the game is to resolve this arbitrary barrier to the use of these unknown objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mechanic that merely introduces an additional hurdle for the player, without the possibility of interesting side effects or interaction with other systems—down with this sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal: to make a game in 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making up the team was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tinyblob"&gt;Aaron Dron&lt;/a&gt;, who, although a sysadmin by trade decided to go rogue and did almost all the artwork. He now knows what a pancreas looks like. In fact he’s probably still haunted by gory internal organs in his dreams after researching all that reference material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/elmarcel"&gt;Daan Nijs&lt;/a&gt; decided he’d like to try writing a game instead of a compiler. He also supplied most of the sound effects and music. &lt;em&gt;I’m pretty sure he just downloaded it though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/innesmck"&gt;Innes McKendrick&lt;/a&gt; who works as a game developer during the day, and moonlights… as a game developer too (crazy!)? He was the lead developer, and also did most of the writing (including the blurb I’ve stolen below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/adurdin"&gt;Me&lt;/a&gt;, who took a break from his web dev role for the game jame. He did most of the gameplay programming and level design, so most of the bugs are probably his fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here’s the game we made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEGITIMATE BUSINESS SIMULATOR 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEGITIMATE BUSINESS SIMULATOR 2013 is a 100% MEDICALLY ACCURATE surgical simulation game. Start out on the lowest rungs of your family business as you fight to keep hearts beating&amp;hellip; and make a cash-grab for vital-organs. This educational adventure game teaches countless life-long lessons, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anatomy - identify popular organs such as the lungs, pancreas and spleen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economics - what determines the street value of a kidney?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budgeting - why shell out on chloroform when a simple hammer will do the job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caution: contains black humour and depictions of internal organs. Cannot guarantee nut-free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The wording [of the SimCity beta EULA] is definitely overreaching, but that’s the nature of EULAs; because there’s basically no punishment for stating something that’s unenforceable, you just throw a bunch of crap in there and see what sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/01/22/bizarre-ea-threatens-bans-for-unreported-simcity-bugs/#comment-1178203"&gt;darkChozo, in a comment on Rock, Paper, Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It looks like the usual cover-your-arse-and-then-some lawyering approach of claiming thrice what is reasonable so that you have a hefty buffer zone after being beaten back to still getting what you really wanted.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e362d1832c822335dbe6a19aacaf2533/tumblr_inline_mgb7vxnPtN1qzlvtz.jpg" alt="“Clementine will remember that” the game says, as Lee talks to Clementine."/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In popular discussion of Telltale Games’ &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve often seen the opinion that the choices you make don’t matter, that they don’t have consequences. Here&amp;rsquo;s how this line of argument goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Episode 4: Your group is escaping from a swarm of walkers, having climbed up the stairs inside a clock tower and escaping across to a nearby roof. But then Ben, bringing up the rear, gets pulled over the railing by a walker, and you only just manage to grab him. He is hanging four stories up above the walker horde as you struggle to try and pull him up; then he says “There’s no time! Let me go!” There are only seconds to decide what to do. ”Lee, we both know,” he says. That he’s a burden. That he stole supplies from the group to placate the bandits. That he failed to stop Clementine wandering off when you left him in charge. That he means well, but that’s all. Do you (a) pull him up, or (b) let him fall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you let him go, he dies. He falls down to the ground, and, badly injured, is set upon by the walkers. If you pull him up, he survives—for the moment. In episode 5, while jumping from a balcony to another roof, the balcony collapses, and Ben falls to his death. In the end Ben died anyway, so it didn’t matter whether you saved him earlier or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this argument is dead wrong. This is not a game about a plot. The twists and turns of fate, the events that befall the game—these don’t matter. Ben would have died either way, but he died by my choice, by my actions: I let him fall in the clocktower. And now Lee has another death on his conscience that he regrets; but Kenny is relieved: he reckons Lee did the best thing for the group, ridding it of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben dies either way, but my choice changes who Lee is. It changes how Kenny sees him. If the others find out, it will change their opinions of Lee. And it changes my perception of events, and my relationship with the characters, and will cause me to make choices differently, or choose my words differently in future than I might otherwise have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is one of the bigger decisions in the game, but the smaller ones matter too. As a character in a different zombie apocalypse story says, “You’ve got to enjoy the little things.” In episode 3, Lee is investigating the theft of supplies, and Duck—Kenny’s hyperactive ten-year-old son—wants to help, playing the role of detective. So I let him. “A clue!” he announces as we find some broken glass. He’s not the sharpest tool in the drawer, but his happy enthusiasm brightens a pretty awful day. And when we find a final clue, I give him a high five. “Duck thinks you’re incredibly awesome,” the game tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this matters, too. Duck thinks I’m great. I think he’s pretty fun to be around. There’s an emotional connection there, which becomes incredibly important in the later events of the episode—but I won’t spoil that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;, the choices you make have consequences in character development, instead of in the plot. Your choices matter enormously. They define the kind of person Lee is, and how Clementine and the other survivors see him. And that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire effects are lovely. All licking flickering twisting hissing tongues of flame, burning blackening cracking and reduce-to-ashing everything in the fireplace. And then all the different toys to burn, each with their own particular effects. All I wanted to do was try more and more new toys to see what burning them would do. And the game wouldn’t let me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, to unlock a catalogue of new things, you need to make predefined combos, by burning two or three specific things at once. And the combos are terribly boring, because they don’t produce any new special effects, just a “combo found” message. So I didn’t find the combos at all fun to try. It was just a tedious slog to do enough combos to unlock the new catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you also have to have bought every single thing from the current catalogue before you can get to the next catalogue. As the items get more expensive, you need more coins to buy them. You get coins whenever you burn things, but only a few more than you spent to get the thing. So as you near the end of a catalogue, you end up buying things you already burned just to grind a few more coins to afford the next item to burn. At least burning new things is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then the waiting! Every item you order from the catalogue takes time to deliver—up to several minutes!—and the more expensive items (and the later catalogues) take longer. So the fire burning the previous toy flickers and dies, and you sit there bored with nothing to do while waiting for the next package’s delivery timer to count down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can speed up delivery by spending stamps. Each stamp will knock one minute off the delivery time for an item. You occasionally get stamps when you burn single things or squash bugs, but the main way to get stamps is by finding combos, and remember how exciting that was? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the game makes you do a lot of waiting, or if you don’t want to wait, you can do boring tasks to reduce the waiting. And you’ll have to far too many of the boring tasks anyway, if you want to see new items or progress the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end it had all become a horrible grind. I have a suspicion that this is intentional as part of the anti-consumerism message that the game thinly disguises—ignore the hypocrisy of such a message in a consumer entertainment product—but it just made the game no fun. There’s a sort of mini-adventure-game coda after the burning part is done, and it was a welcome break, but not actually very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the game started off delightfully. If only they’d just let it be a toy, and not try and force progression and narrative into it, it would have been lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a pirate rob a bank, with a hijacked bus. He stood on top of the bus at one side of the fireplace, and the bank was at the other side. I set alight the front of the bus, and the driver and passengers screamed as the bus accelerated into the bank. The fire spread to the bank, bursting open the vaults and spraying little bits of loose change all over the fireplace. Then “Yar” said the pirate, as he caught fire and burned up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t unlock anything by doing that, but that little bit of play was more fun than anything the game wanted me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

Wood burns. Paper burns. I wonder if this alarm clock will burn? I&amp;rsquo;ll order everything from the catalogue, just to see if it all burns. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop. Burn more, even though it&amp;rsquo;s become a chore. It&amp;rsquo;s just rote now. Keep burning.&lt;/p&gt;

I stand by this: in its theme, its tone, its plot—really in terms of all that distinguishes &lt;em&gt;Max Payne&lt;/em&gt; from other shooters, including in large part the combat—it just does not fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not soulless, just mislabelled. About halfway through the game, I had a sudden realisation and understanding. I saw the game in a new light, and seen this way it all fits together; it all works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Payne 3 is a Die Hard game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max had buried his grief like bullets in a thousand mobster corpses, and as Mona Sax died had found peace with both her death and the deaths of his wife and child. &lt;em&gt;“I had a dream of my wife. She was dead. But it was all right.”&lt;/em&gt; are the final words of Max Payne 2—wherever Max is going from there, it isn’t to the pills and the bottle, as Max Payne 3 suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

You would encounter  Little Sisters in the submarine city of Rapture—the orphaned girls infected with ADAM-producing sea slugs—and had to make a choice: do you destroy the slug and rescue the child? Or do you harvest the slug for the ADAM that you needed, killing her in the process? What a shallow question to ask of the player: do you help someone in need, or greedily murder them to enrich yourself? In the comic book world of Bioshock, you are either a saint or a psychopath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metro 2033 came out a couple of years after Bioshock, but it didn’t get anywhere near the critical attention. Which is a pity, because it quietly treads new ground in several ways, including a morality system of its own. Both games have two endings, with the one you get depending on the moral choices made throughout the game. But where Bioshock was blatant, Metro is subtle and delicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metro 2033’s moral choices aren’t about whether you are good or bad, they’re simply about your character: are you curious? thoughtful? impulsive? vengeful? generous? reckless? merciful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game doesn’t judge you, it just gives you the ending consistent with the character you played. It’s not a “good” ending or a “bad” ending. What’s bad about Hunter’s philosophy, “if it’s hostile, you kill it”? That’s the thought behind the ending that most people get, where you destroy the Dark Ones who have been attacking the survivors in the Metro. It’s simple, direct, and rational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the series of small choices you make throughout the game show that you are the kind of person who might be open to it, it gives you a final chance—you can still let the missile launch continue and kill the Dark Ones, if you agree with Hunter’s reasoning; but if you had cared to, by this point you can understand why the Dark Ones were hostile, and realise that perhaps they don’t deserve to be wiped out because of it, and choose accordingly. That’s why the achievement for this ending is called “Enlightened”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been trying to write this post for a long time, but after many failed starts, only found the words I wanted when &lt;a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/29/dear-videogames-stop-telling-me-everything/#comment-1074310"&gt;replying&lt;/a&gt; to a comment on Rock, Paper Shotgun. And then before finishing it, I found a &lt;a href="http://thurot.com/2012/09/06/metro-2033-the-index/"&gt;wonderful five-part discussion of the same aspect&lt;/a&gt; of Metro 2033 by Dan Thurot over at the improbably named Space-Biff!

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s missing from this conversation is that map usage is critical. Regardless of Google&amp;rsquo;s PR success in the Atlantic&amp;rsquo;s unintentionally misleading &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/"&gt;Google Ground Truth infomercial&lt;/a&gt;, more than half of Google&amp;rsquo;s mobile map usage is going away in the next month or two. I love the Atlantic, but they got punkd. Usage makes maps better a lot faster than software does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data&lt;/em&gt; make maps better a lot faster than usage does. And the data that Apple has chosen to serve to us is a lot less accurate and current than Google&amp;rsquo;s map data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it is laughably bad. Here in Edinburgh, the building outlines have an inexplicable offset, so that they overlap and obscure the actual streets—somewhat defeating its entire purpose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s quote floating round from some of the devs on AC3 about how playing their game on Easy is effectively the same as reading the abridged version of a novel. I find it really troubling that senior developers on a major franchise could be so fucking inept as to think this is in any way true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison to novels is stupid. In terms of interaction, all books all have the same difficulty level: the skill of the reader to turn the page. Games need difficulty levels because the skill levels of the audience vary—and they depend innately on the performance of that audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: The &lt;a href="http://www.edge-online.com/news/assassins-creed-iii-devs-easy-mode-often-ruins-games"&gt;original quote from Edge&lt;/a&gt; does not make the comparison to abridged books, but says:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a problem unique to videogames, he continues, lamenting the fact that this is the only creative industry that needs to provide difficulty options.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It’s like if I picked up a book and it said, &amp;lsquo;Do you want the easy version or the complicated version?&amp;rsquo; [Game designers] can simplify the language, you know; we can make it two syllables.&amp;rdquo;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m97anugzwX1qzlvtz.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m97aobRFpv1qzlvtz.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I had selected some text with newlines, the same command will instead put the tags on preceding and subsequent lines at the same indent level, and indent the contents one level deeper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m97aqp6rAi1qzlvtz.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, immediately after invoking the command, the selection is set to the starting tag name, and whatever I type there is mirrored to the end tag—but not including whitespace or anything after it. So if I hit the shortcut key, and type &lt;code&gt;p class='example'&lt;/code&gt;, I get sensible results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m97avt4pZE1qzlvtz.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In TextMate, this is done with a custom Python script that examines the selection, and outputs a snippet. The snippet is dynamically generated so that it can contain the necessary line breaks and indentation already. It is then the snippet that handles the mirroring of the start tag to the end tag, with a regex substitution applied to omit the whitespace and any attributes after it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command has been invaluable to me when editing HTML (which I do a lot), but I have been unable to figure out how to write a similar command within Sublime Text 2. Multiple selections would seem to be obvious for mirroring the start tag content to the end tag, but without the crucial omission of attributes. So for now I have the inconvenient situation of using Sublime Text 2 for editing most files, but opening up TextMate whenever I’m working with HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Sublime Text 2 guru, do you know how this could be done in it?&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>textmate</tag><tag>sublime text 2</tag></post><post id="23961744784" url="https://backslashn.com/post/23961744784" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/23961744784/epinephrine" type="regular" date-gmt="2012-05-28 23:45:24 GMT" date="Tue, 29 May 2012 00:45:24" unix-timestamp="1338248724" format="markdown" reblog-key="mXgzLtRu" slug="epinephrine" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Epinephrine</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;So I was in the shop in Polana, scrounging for supplies. I was just picking up some tins of food, when all of a sudden, CRACK CRASH THUNK &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207251616817086465" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:26:50+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;A bullet flies through the window and impacts the wall nearby. I instantly go prone between the shelves. My heart is pounding, I&amp;rsquo;m sweating. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207252083378888704" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:28:41+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;I have no idea where the sniper is, or what he can see. After lying still for five seconds, I stand up and run like hell out the back doors. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207252362925060096" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:29:48+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;Outside the shop, I don&amp;rsquo;t stop. I sprint between buildings, heading down into the wooded valley south of the town. Several zeds give chase. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207252573961457665" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:30:38+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;One zed hits me, I&amp;rsquo;m bleeding a bit. I keep running, zigzagging, until I&amp;rsquo;m about 500m south of town. I turn and shoot until the zeds fall. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207252778106630144" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:31:27+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;I keep running for nearly 10 minutes, changing course every few, putting as much distance between myself and the town as I can. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207252979735203840" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:32:15+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;Eventually, I find a pair of pine trees in the woods and drop between them. I wait, listening, waiting for my heart to slow back down. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adurdin/status/207253298271625220" data-datetime="2012-05-28T23:33:31+00:00"&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not for revenge; not because I wanted something he had; I think just because I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wall that separates life from death is so thin. Being alive feels so active, so permanent that we forget how little it takes to shatter it: just 10 grams of lead moving at 800 metres per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My victim—no, that doesn’t sound right. &lt;em&gt;The man&lt;/em&gt; hadn’t seen me lying prone in the dirt beside a bush. He had just gone into a nearby barn, looking for supplies I guess. He was obviously new to the area: a veteran would have long since ditched the small Coyote backpack and Makarov pistol that he carried for something better. And I guess he was low on ammunition, too, because when he spooked a few zeds, he fired only three shots before he turned and ran. Right into my sights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I could have helped him out, killed the two zeds that were after him. The thought never crossed my mind—in fact I didn’t really think anything at all. He was there, running, and I was there unseen, with my gun, and him in the sights. I fired once, and he fell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murders: 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zeds were still intent on him, clawing at his corpse, and ignored me. I shot them too, for safety. Then I figured I might as well see what he’d been carrying. A tin of beans. An empty water bottle. Painkillers. Nothing of any real value. I might have kept the beans; I don’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While still beside his body, I saw another figure not far off, running along the road that crossed the field ahead. Instinct made me lie down, beside the corpses, as I kept my gun on this new arrival. Coyote backpack. Makarov. Carelessly visible as he ran down the road. Another rookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, because I could. I fired once, I think I missed. He started, but continued to move. Twice more, and his silhouette collapsed into the grass. I still felt nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murders: 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have any hope that he would have anything else I wanted. But he did: a compass, a hunting knife, matches. It was only then, taking these from his corpse that I felt a momentary guilt; but it quickly faded, swallowed by the apprehension that someone else might have heard my shots, and do to me what I had just done to these two. I left the road and the buildings behind me, and plunged back into the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward, cautious, over sand to the mountain. Wind blows the sanddrift through my cloak billowing, scarf waving. A sound, musical voice, and I echo it, turn to see echo of myself beside, companion. Through the desert, ruins and stones, as the clothbirds soar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling, darkening. Now deep we press on. Sombre void halls, and a red eye glimmering, predator hunting. Cower beneath, breathless till it passes. Forward, cautious, eyes all around. Cautious. Reach at last the light, stretching far underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising to sunlight, now at the mountain. Wind blows the snowdrift freezing. Flagging, upslope, huddling for warmth. Each foot, step, step, step. Cower behind, as the storm rises. Step. Higher. No warmth, no sunlight, no goal. No hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewing, respiriting, resinging, break through the storm. Rising and leaping up to the mountain, higher, flying above. Closer the cleft, fuller the thrill, rising and deepening, and climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my TF2 king of the hill map &lt;a href="http://forums.tf2maps.net/showthread.php?t=11253"&gt;koth_skylab&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted an ending sequence that would use a trigger to set the losing team on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual way of distinguishing between teams in a trigger is to use a &lt;b&gt;filter_activator_tfteam&lt;/b&gt;. It has a &lt;b&gt;Team&lt;/b&gt; property which can be set to the red team or blue team. Spawn room doors are a typical use of this filter, to allow only Red players into the Red spawn room, and only Blue players into the Blu spawn room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02kmkt2R71qzlvtz.png" alt="Opening a spawn room door" width="509" height="209"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative property, &lt;b&gt;Associated Control Point&lt;/b&gt;, allows the filter to allow only playersfrom whichver team owns a particular control point. A trigger using this filter, connected to a door, would only open the door for Red players if Red had captured the control point, and similarly for Blue if Blue owned the point. If the control point was neutral, the door would open for nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02knpjZeI1qzlvtz.png" alt="Opening a door for the control point holders" width="509" height="205"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding the winners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a king of the hill map, there is a single control point. Each team must try to hold the point for as long as possible. A team wins when they have held the control point cumulatively for a certain time; e.g. three minutes. Consequently, you can identify the winning team as the team that owns the control point when the round finishes. The winning team then gets ten seconds or so—the “humiliation period”—in which to slaughter the losers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Red team wins a round, the &lt;b&gt;tf_gamerules&lt;/b&gt; entity sends the &lt;b&gt;OnWonByTeam1&lt;/b&gt; output; when Blue wins, it sends the &lt;b&gt;OnWonByTeam2&lt;/b&gt; output. If you have a trigger, filtered by the control point, that is &lt;em&gt;initially disabled&lt;/em&gt;, and then enable it when either team wins, only the winning players will activate the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really want to set the winners on fire—it would be a strange reward for winning—but I’ll add the logic here so you can see how it works. When the trigger gets an &lt;b&gt;OnStartTouch&lt;/b&gt; input, it sends the &lt;b&gt;IgnitePlayer&lt;/b&gt; output to &lt;b&gt;!activator&lt;/b&gt;, which is the special identifier for “the entity that sent the input”, which in this case will be any player matching the filter. Hammer may not recognise these options, and will display them in red, but they will work just fine in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02kohPZco1qzlvtz.png" alt="Setting the winning team on fire" width="509" height="298"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding the losers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the losers should be easy. The third property on &lt;b&gt;filter_activator_tfteam&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;b&gt;Filter Mode&lt;/b&gt;. Set this to &lt;b&gt;Disallow&lt;/b&gt;, and instead of allowing the matching team to activate the trigger, the filter will disallow them, and allow every other player to activate it. The team-filtered door in the second example above would open for both teams when nobody owned the point, for the Red team when Blue owned the point, and for the Blue team when Red owned the point. For pyromaniacs, the trigger shown below will set the entire losing team in the trigger area on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02kp3rN031qzlvtz.png" alt="Setting the losing team on fire - with a bug"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a catch. If you enable this trigger during the round, it will work exactly as expected: the team that owns the point will be unaffected, and the team that doesn’t own it will burn. But if the trigger is enabled in the humiliation period after the round ends, &lt;em&gt;both teams&lt;/em&gt; catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that for the duration of the humiliation period, all team-based filters will always match the winning team. This is so that the winning Blu team can open the spawn room doors of the losing Red team (or vice-versa), to slaughter any cowardly players trying to hide in it—a worthy cause, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it causes me a little problem: although I can identify the winners, those-who-own-the-control-point, the inverted logic those-who-don’t-own-the-control-point that should identify the losers also matches the winners. It’s incredibly funny when both teams catch fire, but it’s not quite what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;All is not lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can still identify the losers, and only the losers, but those-who-don’t-own-the-control-point isn’t good enough because of the peculiar behaviour of &lt;b&gt;filter_activator_tfteam&lt;/b&gt; after the round. What I need is to take the effect of the winning team filter (which still only matches the winners after the round ends) and invert its logic in some other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s another filter entity in Source, &lt;b&gt;filter_multi&lt;/b&gt;, which allows you to create complex filters by performing logical operations on several other filters that you specify. If you set its &lt;b&gt;Logic Type&lt;/b&gt; property to AND, it will pass only if all the other filters pass; set it to OR, and it will pass if any one of the other filters pass. I don&amp;rsquo;t need that capability here, but &lt;b&gt;filter_multi&lt;/b&gt; also has a &lt;b&gt;Negate Outcome&lt;/b&gt; property, which turns what would be a pass into a fail, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that the output of the &lt;b&gt;filter_multi&lt;/b&gt; is not affected by team logic or humiliation periods at all, but only by the outputs of the other filters it specifies. So although the &lt;b&gt;Filter Mode&lt;/b&gt; property of the &lt;b&gt;filter_activator_tfteam&lt;/b&gt; turned out to be unsuitable, if I use a winning team filter and send its output through a negated &lt;b&gt;filter_multi&lt;/b&gt;, it will match only the losing team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m02kpti1sb1qzlvtz.png" alt="Setting only the losing team on fire" width="509" height="370"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one small issue remaining with our trigger and filter set up: the &lt;b&gt;filter_activator_tfteam&lt;/b&gt; matches all players on the winning team, and so the &lt;b&gt;filter_multi&lt;/b&gt;, being negated, matches everything else. Not just players, but all other entities. The fix for this is easy: just ensure the trigger flags are set to just &lt;b&gt;Clients&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>source engine</tag><tag>tf2</tag></post><post id="16182982743" url="https://backslashn.com/post/16182982743" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/16182982743/the-mpaa-studios-hate-us" type="regular" date-gmt="2012-01-20 20:08:04 GMT" date="Fri, 20 Jan 2012 20:08:04" unix-timestamp="1327090084" format="markdown" reblog-key="yAxlNjzN" slug="the-mpaa-studios-hate-us" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>The MPAA studios hate us</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;blockquote&gt;

Its points-for-combos approach to combat and emphasis on using environmental hazards is fresh and exciting, but the story it has to tell follows Epic&amp;rsquo;s trademark bro-gamer recipe, with a sprinkling of comedy—sadly not self-aware enough to be parody.

&lt;p&gt;That’s fine: these are chieftains, or guardians of great treasures, or whatnot, so naturally they’d surround themselves with minions for their own defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, what bothers me is what all too often comes next: a convenient doorway that leads directly out of this deepest hold of the dungeon and back to the outside world. Even more irritating is when this exit has you emerging right beneath the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brad Gallaway, in his post &lt;a href="http://drinkingcoffeecola.blogspot.com/2011/11/fifteen-hours-with-skyrim-and-thats.html"&gt;Fifteen Hours With
Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; described this happening in Skyrim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost every dungeon I’ve been to roughly follows the same “underground
  narrow hallways with some larger rooms” blueprint, and each final chamber has
  a very convenient shortcut door back to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not played Skyrim yet, but I’ve noticed this pattern occurring a lot in Oblivion, Fallout 3, and to some extent also in Zelda games and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why it irritates. Imagine, if you will, a narrator, telling the tale of this hero (my avatar) and his quest into the dungeon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The hero Ulfang dares to enter the Cave of Unfirthaur. For days he slays many goblins in the Upper Chambers; he defeats the three Guardian Trolls in the Middle Halls; and finally, a week after entering, he penetrates to the deep Underfortress, where he vanquishes the great Gnarr himself, and takes his prized jewels.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrator takes a sip of water to moisten his throat, and continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ulfang now spends another week retracing—”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looks up at me. “You look a little impatient. Tell you what, why don&amp;rsquo;t we skip ahead to when Ulfang gets back outside. I’ll just pretend that there was a little express elevator here that takes him back to the surface in just a few minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t!” I plead. “It doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;fit&lt;/em&gt;. You can’t break the rules of the world just for me. It isn’t my world—it’s Ulfang’s world, and Gnarr’s. And if Gnarr has a fortress seven miles deep, then by The Dribbling Goddess, Ulfang should have to walk back out the same way he came in!” But it is too late. The narrator has already changed the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My complaint isn’t about realism, but &lt;em&gt;verisimilitude&lt;/em&gt;. In a moment, the game world has broken the fourth wall and is now acknowledging me, the player directly, instead of my avatar. It’s a disconcerting discontinuity, like the pop and skipping of a scratched track on a CD.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>game design</tag></post><post id="13823359242" url="https://backslashn.com/post/13823359242" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/13823359242/stalkers-and-anomalies" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-12-06 12:02:00 GMT" date="Tue, 06 Dec 2011 12:02:00" unix-timestamp="1323172920" format="markdown" reblog-key="hRfaLs6y" slug="stalkers-and-anomalies" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Stalkers and Anomalies</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvs6pcOkno1qzlvtz.jpg" alt="A lone stalker dares searing heat and jets of flame in the bitumen anomaly."/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Call_of_Pripyat"&gt;Call of Pripyat&lt;/a&gt;, there are areas of odd chemical, electrical, fire, or gravitational behaviour (and usually high radiation also); these are called anomalies. For the most part these are merely incidental obstacles in your way, but from time to time objects called &amp;ldquo;artifacts&amp;rdquo; appear in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These artifacts are highly valuable to sell, but if you carry them they also provide protective ability, mostly against the hazards of the anomalies. So they are well worth the time to carefully explore the anomaly fields (throwing bolts to identify where the anomalies lie and where is safe to walk) to find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the parlance of the game (something it borrows from the book Roadside Picnic which inspires it), &amp;ldquo;stalker&amp;rdquo; is the name given to the people who wander the zone, hunting for artifacts. It contrasts with the military or paramilitary factions and bandits who are also there; unlike those groups, stalkers usually travel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game itself has a very rich AI system: animals hunt, feed, and sleep; and defend their territory against intrusion from humans. But there are also many NPCs from all factions that are AI-controlled. The military go on patrols, the stalkers explore the anomalies hunting for artifacts, and the bandits look for lone stalkers to steal from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this contributes greatly to the feel of the zone as a living place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/402924544/stalker-call-of-pripyat"&gt;I wrote about my experience in Call of Pripyat&lt;/a&gt; when I first played it on release in February 2010.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>stalker</tag><tag>call of pripyat</tag></post><post id="13723873499" url="https://backslashn.com/post/13723873499" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/13723873499/on-the-bottom-half-of-the-internet" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-12-04 11:42:12 GMT" date="Sun, 04 Dec 2011 11:42:12" unix-timestamp="1322998932" format="markdown" reblog-key="RZQXOSwu" slug="on-the-bottom-half-of-the-internet" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>On “the bottom half of the Internet”</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;“The bottom half of the Internet” is an interesting phrase, especially when it is accompanied (as it so often is) by an admonishment to shun it. The phrase refers to user commentary on websites, and is an implicit declaration of superiority—we are the people you should listen to, not those filthy commenters down there. How could they possibly have anything worthwhile to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-applauding sentiment inherent to the phrase seems so obviously deserving of derision that I’m surprised it needs pointing out; but it seems many deploying the phrase have their heads so far up their own intestinal tracts that they’ve become accustomed to the smell of their own shit. If only they would pull their heads out, they might find that there is a fertile field of others’ shit out there too. (I fear I was carried away by a turn of phrase and have taken this metaphor a little too far.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, let us leave the sewerage department for the moment. These would-be aristocrats of the Internet make another mistake: they attempt to justify their commentatist polemic with attempted rational argument. They start with broad generalisations, that comments are useless reactions, not considered argument. They use ludicrous examples (I found a wonderful specimen just the other day: “When Leonardo da Vinci painted the ‘Mona Lisa’, after all, he didn’t leave a blank bit at the bottom”). And they finally shore up that rickety structure by dusting off the long-discredited anonymity argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don’t at all mean to defend the deluge of thoughtless wittering that occurs wherever people communicate—whether in neckties around a punch-bowl, or beneath an entertaining YouTube video, or even in the blog posts of all those well-educated, literate twats—and I doubt even the authors of most comments would consider their efforts worthy of permanent preservation; but if the Internet is good at anything, it is perpetuating all that happens on it. The horde of reaction-seeking trolls deduced this long ago, and use it to their advantage when leaving useless, provocative comments. But the subtlest dress up in the suits and ties of the commentatists, and post as one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m interrupting a conversation: the girlfriend of the driver I&amp;rsquo;m possessing is declaring that nothing in the city scares her. I take that as a personal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the accelerator and touch the handbrake, drifting the car sideways down the winding road. She yawns exaggeratedly. I swerve into oncoming traffic, barely missing a large truck. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t even merit a response. I have to step up my game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a car transporter truck ahead, with its ramp down. Floor it, shove in a boost to reach 150 miles an hour, and take the ramp at an angle for a high corkscrew. The car is flying through the air, upside-down, and she says one word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lame.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laugh aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game has a truckload of incidental dialogue. I&amp;rsquo;ve psychically commandeered hundreds of cars while playing it, and although not every car has a passenger (and hence dialogue), a good many do. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard dozens of these short conversations, and not run into any duplicates yet. And each has more lines of unique dialogue as you drive recklessly, get chased by the cops, lose the cops, or just obliterate your car against a wall. The scenarios are diverse and creative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two gangsters in a stolen car, desperate to avoid police attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An octogenarian woman, whose suddenly reckless driving frightens her daughter in the passenger seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blind passenger who thinks a demon has just possessed the driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in a high-speed pursuit, a cop reveals to her partner that she is transsexual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these are all incidental: they form part of no mission, but occur as you shift into random cars. The creativity and humour in the writing added greatly to my enjoyment of the game.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>driver san francisco</tag></post><post id="13173497372" url="https://backslashn.com/post/13173497372" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/13173497372/plus-%C3%A7a-change-plus-%C3%A7est-la-m%C3%AAme-chose" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-11-22 22:12:30 GMT" date="Tue, 22 Nov 2011 22:12:30" unix-timestamp="1321999950" format="markdown" reblog-key="FLdgq3KI" slug="plus-ça-change-plus-çest-la-même-chose" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Plus ça change, plus ç'est la même chose</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/11/21/venus-with-biceps/"&gt;@brainpickings&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Many artists think that games are about attention to graphical details and in extension to proving how ambitious they are. They should go make art.

If you’ve played it, two words will be enough to tell you why: Meat Circus. It’s the final level of the game; it gets off to a great start with an annoying escort mission, follows that with an uninspired boss fight, then a long and horribly finicky platforming sequence, followed by two more boss fights that are slight variations on the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one part in the middle of the platforming sequence that always defeated me: you have to climb around an ascending spiral of walls, jumping the gaps between them. The tightness of the spiral, the fire on the walls that would make you lose your grip and fall, the double-jump requiring very rapid button presses to work at all, and the camera swivelling at inconvenient times all combined to make this section impassible for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, a patch was released for &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/"&gt;the Steam version of the game&lt;/a&gt;, which among other things apparently &lt;a href="http://www.1up.com/news/psychonauts-updated-new-features-pc-mac-now-available"&gt;reduced the difficulty of Meat Circus&lt;/a&gt;. I think I’ve figured out what changed: it appears that you no longer fall to your death whenever you take damage in that awful platforming section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I finally beat the Meat Circus on this new, easier version. It still took me around thirty tries to get past that horrific spiral climbing bit; and I died a dozen or so times on the following section, but fortunately there was a checkpoint after the spiral. After that, the two bosses were a piece of cake, although thanks to another bug the FMV cutscenes weren’t working on my machine, so I didn’t see the final cutscene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the end of an era: Psychonauts has at last moved to the pile of games I have finished. The final level is still a strong contender for the worst bit of any game I’ve played, but the rest of the game is so hilarious, it’s worth playing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>psychonauts</tag></post><post id="11271092651" url="https://backslashn.com/post/11271092651" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/11271092651/ui-entering-a-new-password" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-10-10 12:58:06 GMT" date="Mon, 10 Oct 2011 13:58:06" unix-timestamp="1318251486" format="markdown" reblog-key="8yMCFUZe" slug="ui-entering-a-new-password" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>UI: Entering a new password</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://littlebigdetails.com/post/11226935030/pinboard-in-when-changing-your-password-the-new"&gt;Little Big Details&lt;/a&gt; today showed the form used on &lt;a href="http://pinboard.in"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; when entering a new password, where the field for the new password only appears once, and uses very light grey text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lsuocceuVY1qzlvtz.png" alt=""/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, a form will ask you to enter your new password twice, and both fields will be masked with • bullets. The form will ask for the new password a second time in case you unknowingly made a typo the first time. In this case the two fields will not match, so the form can warn you about the typo and ask you to try again. If it only asked for the new password once with a masked field, a typo could go undetected until you try to log in—the correct new password, lacking the typo, would not be accepted. Pinboard’s form solves this by ensuring that you can read back your new password to verify its correctness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, I have a silly, irrational fear with forms of this type that I will make the same typo both times I enter the password, and so still be unable to log in when entering the password correctly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal behind masking passwords is, of course, to prevent them being disclosed through shoulder surfing. Pinboard’s light grey text makes it harder to read the password from a distance than if it were darker, but it’s still quite possible. And yet the text is light enough that it will be difficult to read for many users, especially with varied lighting conditions and monitor colour reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the traditional form with two masked fields has an unexpected benefit, albeit slight. While the intention of the two fields is to prevent typos, by having the user type their password twice without being able to see it, it also begins to train their muscle memory. Having typed the password twice without seeing it, you begin to learn the physical pattern of the letters on the keyboard. It is quite possible to know a password better physically than by letters. I can type most of my passwords rapidly, but have difficulty recalling the actual spelling of them.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>ui</tag><tag>ux</tag><tag>passwords</tag></post><post id="11157343128" url="https://backslashn.com/post/11157343128" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/11157343128/perhaps-drm-does-have-a-place" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-10-07 23:21:45 GMT" date="Sat, 08 Oct 2011 00:21:45" unix-timestamp="1318029705" format="markdown" reblog-key="xptaeSJK" slug="perhaps-drm-does-have-a-place" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>“Perhaps DRM does have a place…”</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps DRM does have a place, but Ubisoft has tried harder than any other publisher to solve this problem, and business has suffered.

&lt;p&gt;“And they do have that right. But PC gamers work hard for their money, too, and they deserve full-featured games that let them have the best experiences possible on their chosen platform. They deserve a publisher that cares more about its customers than its resentments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Was choosing &amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; a bad idea / horribly insensitive to colorblind people? Like, will they be able to distinguish the non-portalable metal plating from the stone walls? I don&amp;rsquo;t want a BioShock 2 debacle on my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href="http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2011/06/question-for-colorblind-idea-of.html"&gt;Radiator Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave me an idea. I knew there was &lt;a href="http://vision.psychol.cam.ac.uk/jdmollon/papers/colourmaps.pdf"&gt;research into simulating the effects of colourblindness&lt;/a&gt;, and had come across applications that implemented the method from that paper: &lt;a href="http://colororacle.cartography.ch/index.html"&gt;Color Oracle&lt;/a&gt; for one. I also knew that the Source engine supported colour mapping. So why not combine the two, to simulate colourblindness in game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MNftD6vPrAk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Putting the bits together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colour mapping in the Source engine is done with the &lt;a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Color_correction"&gt;&lt;code&gt;color_correction&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; entity. You can start the game—Team Fortress 2 for example—in &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; mode to create and save a colour map file. You then create a &lt;code&gt;color_correction&lt;/code&gt; entity in your map within Hammer, and configure it to use your colour map file. But the tools for creating colour maps are fairly basic, and I needed more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a short &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; script to convert a colour map to a &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; image file, and vice-versa. I also set it up so it could generate an identity colour map file or image; that is, one in which every colour remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three common forms of colourblindness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deuteranomaly/deuteranopia (red/green), which affects about 5% of men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protanamoaly/protanopia (red/green), which affects about 2.5% of men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tritanomaly/tritanopia (blue/yellow), which affects less than 1% of men
and women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simulation that is done here is of the &amp;ldquo;anopia&amp;rdquo; forms, where one of the types of cones in the eye is missing or completely non-functional. The &amp;ldquo;anomaly&amp;rdquo; forms are less severe, but as I understand it, if your visual design is accessible to people with deuteranopia, it will be at least as good for people with deuteranomaly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the colour maps for these, instead of doing the maths described in the paper, I converted the identity colour map to an image and opened it in Photoshop. I then used Color Oracle to view the image with each simulation, took a screenshot of each, and saved them back to &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; files. Finally, I converted each of the &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; files back into colour maps to use in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step was to put the necessary entities into my map to turn on colour correction with each colour map in turn, and test it out in the game. Here is each colour map image, with a screenshot of how it appears in-game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Identity (normal appearance)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tritanopia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tritanopia colour map" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loefjw4OGD1qzlvtz.png" width="512" height="16"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Try it for yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have posted the colour maps and the python script &lt;a href="https://github.com/adurdin/source-colorblind"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I have also included a prefab of the colour correction entities, so you can easily drop them into any map you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One more thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the script will convert any suitably-sized &lt;code&gt;.tga&lt;/code&gt; to a colour map or vice versa, you are no longer limited to the tools Valve provides to create colour maps, but can use all the tools that Photoshop or any other image editor provides to adjust the colours in the image, then convert the result back to a color map for use in the game.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="6766984575" url="https://backslashn.com/post/6766984575" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/6766984575/john-gruber-commenting-on-an-extrapolation-of" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-06-21 21:06:34 GMT" date="Tue, 21 Jun 2011 22:06:34" unix-timestamp="1308690394" format="markdown" reblog-key="F62GYJHM" slug="john-gruber-commenting-on-an-extrapolation-of" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/06/21/harrison-games"&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;, commenting on an extrapolation of Apple’s growing role in the games industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And the Apple TV doesn’t support apps yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m far from certain that it ever will. The biggest problem for games on the AppleTV alone? The controller sucks. Even for the little it has to do right now, the remote is clumsy, and slow to give feedback. You can&amp;rsquo;t press the buttons quickly. It takes too long to start scrolling, and you always overshoot. It’s really not enjoyable to interact with the AppleTV via the remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With iOS 5 and AirPlay we already have the ability to &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/17/real-racing-2-hd-wireless-dual-screen-gaming-with-ios-5-on-ipad/"&gt;play a game on the iPad or iPhone, with the display on the TV&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s reliant on the phone rendering and encoding the video data, and streaming that to the AppleTV—and it lags, quite noticeably, if that video is anything to go by. And it eats your iPad battery much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the AppleTV could do really well is run half a game—graphics rendering, physics, networking. Your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch runs the other half—input, game logic, drawing only the secondary display on the device. With the huge bandwidth and processing demands of the video streaming gone, the control responsiveness would increase, and the battery drain is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now in the iCloud beta, I can buy an app on my iPhone, and it automatically downloads and installs on my iPad, too. The same infrastructure could allow the “server” half of a game to automatically download to my AppleTV, so it was ready to play as I continue my game in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="6587649419" url="https://backslashn.com/post/6587649419" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/6587649419/simulate-cellular-connections-on-mac-for-ios" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-06-16 14:36:31 GMT" date="Thu, 16 Jun 2011 15:36:31" unix-timestamp="1308234991" format="markdown" reblog-key="BE9bNC1t" slug="simulate-cellular-connections-on-mac-for-ios" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Simulate cellular connections on Mac (for iOS simulator)</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Oliver Drobnik, at &lt;a href="http://www.cocoanetics.com/2011/06/how-to-simulate-cellular-connections-on-your-mac/"&gt;Cocoanetics&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now our trick creates a new IP firewall rule restricting the bandwidth to 112 kBits. You have to do this modification as root, hence the sudo and the first sudo will ask for your root password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo ipfw add 500 pipe 1 ip from any to any
sudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 112kbit/s plr 0 delay 20ms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Now you can test your app in simulator and enjoy the much faster turnaround when debugging the handling of slow connections.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To remove the firewall rule you use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo ipfw delete 500
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep intending to make a note of these commands for future reference, every time I see them—this time I’ve done it.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="6332659044" url="https://backslashn.com/post/6332659044" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/6332659044/music-bought-june-11" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-06-08 22:11:09 GMT" date="Wed, 08 Jun 2011 23:11:09" unix-timestamp="1307571069" format="markdown" reblog-key="zQAhuRz7" slug="music-bought-june-11" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Music Bought: June ’11</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the music I bought this month.&lt;/p&gt;

He’d barely managed to kill a couple of coyotes the night before, so he figured some more practice in broad daylight would help him get his hand back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an old mutt wandering around the ranch: a mangy old thing. Nobody knew where it had come from, and John was pretty sure nobody would miss it. And anyways, it was just a dog. He unslung his rifle, took aim, and fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn’t the first time John Marsten had misjudged a situation. The dog was dead all right, but folk seemed none too happy about it. They started running and screaming, and them as had horses got up and galloped around all over the place. It was quite a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bullet whistled past, and John suddenly got the idea he  might ought to be running himself. He got the uncanny feeling that he now had a $5 bounty on hid head, despite that the old dog couldn’t have been worth more than a dime. But with folks shooting at him, it wasn’t the time to stand around. He ran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out John Marston was pretty good at running, despite his wound. It took about five minutes and half a mile, but he finally lost his pursuers round about Pike’s Basin. He stopped a moment to catch his breath, then figured he’d walk back to the ranch and tell everybody it was all just a misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>red dead redemption</tag><tag>games</tag></post><post id="5961579024" url="https://backslashn.com/post/5961579024" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/5961579024/are-you-drunk" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-05-29 11:22:13 GMT" date="Sun, 29 May 2011 12:22:13" unix-timestamp="1306668133" format="markdown" reblog-key="eBaVIDuW" slug="are-you-drunk" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Are you drunk?</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Kris over at &lt;a href="http://www.screencuisine.net/2011/05/27/lady-business-the-traffic-report/"&gt;Screen Cuisine&lt;/a&gt; writes entertainingly about her attempt at playing &lt;em&gt;L.

  &lt;p&gt;“It took me way longer than I’d like to admit to figure out how to get down to the crime scene. Even though there was a map, I kept running in circles and trying to run off cliffs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a discussion on Twitter some weeks back, where someone—I forget who now—asked, when can game designers stop including basic movement tutorials in games, and just presume the player already has the knowledge and skill? My answer was never, if the games are being made for a mainstream audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotes like Kris’s remind us that even movement with the conventional third-person controls is a complex activity, requiring precise thumb movements and coordination between both hands. It is not obvious but must be learned, and requires hours of practice to develop what most gamers would consider a normal level of skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have observed several of my non-gamer friends—usually when I encourage them to try a game—having difficulty with the unfamiliar controls, whether the console controller’s sticks or the WASD+mouse of PCs. Being unable to make your avatar do what you want can be very frustrating, and without encouragement many have given up, saying “I’m not good at games.” This is unfortunate because they’re usually doing fine with the other aspects of gameplay—strategies, resource management, or puzzle solving—but the lack of controller skill is a barrier for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games made for a wide audience should continue to include basic control tutorials. Even more importantly, they should ensure their opening areas are welcoming, not punishing for new players, giving them a safe environment to learn the game and the controls.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="5605088765" url="https://backslashn.com/post/5605088765" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/5605088765/it-also-says-here-that-youre-adopted-so-thats" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-05-18 12:27:07 GMT" date="Wed, 18 May 2011 13:27:07" unix-timestamp="1305721627" format="markdown" reblog-key="hEhpIIvF" slug="it-also-says-here-that-youre-adopted-so-thats" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>“It also says here that you’re adopted. So that’s funny too.”</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Hitting the games news today is the story of a father who, playing
&lt;em&gt;Portal 2&lt;/em&gt; with his adopted daughter, is upset when GLaDOS and Wheatley make
fun of the protagonist for being adopted. You can &lt;a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/110146-Adoptive-Parents-Call-Portal-2-Jokes-Offensive-to-Orphans"&gt;read the story in &lt;em&gt;The
Escapist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
or see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUQYrdgIJuI"&gt;the report on his local TV
news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sympathetic with the father. He’s rightly concerned that his daughter
could be hurt by the insults. Although in the context of the game these are
meant as jokes, some of GLaDOS’s remarks are very mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Don&amp;rsquo;t let that &amp;ldquo;horrible person&amp;rdquo; thing discourage you. It&amp;rsquo;s just a data point.
  If it makes you feel any better, science has now validated your birth mother&amp;rsquo;s
  decision to abandon you on a doorstep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, speaking about the protagonist’s parents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If it makes you feel any better, they abandoned you at birth. So I very seriously
  doubt they’d even want to see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Tell you what, let&amp;rsquo;s give your parents a call right now.“ [Phone dialling sound]
  “The birth parents you are trying to reach do not love you. Please hang up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humour in these comes not from them remarks themselves, but their context.
GLaDOS is a superintelligent AI who—in the first game—tried to kill the
protagonist, but failed, and was dismantled and defeated by them. Now, after
being switched back on, she’s taking petty revenge. It’s funny.
It’s funny because this superintelligent AI that tried to kill you can now
only resort to such pathetic insults, like a cowardly school bully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also funny when Wheatley tries to use the same tactics, because his
insult, “Adopted&amp;hellip; fatty! Fatty fatty no parents!” is laughably weak. It’s
like he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even understand how insults work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt it’s easier to find these funny when the insult doesn’t apply to you.
Getting called mean names and learning to cope with it is a part of growing up
for most kids, but I don’t think any parent would want their child to have to
go through it. So I’m sympathetic to the father’s position, but I believe
taking the story to his local TV news is the worst thing he could have done.
He’s now basically guaranteed that the poor girl will get called “fatty fatty
no-parents” by other kids at school.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="5459473864" url="https://backslashn.com/post/5459473864" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/5459473864/music-bought-may-11" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-05-13 21:26:00 GMT" date="Fri, 13 May 2011 22:26:00" unix-timestamp="1305321960" format="markdown" reblog-key="jgIB0sZO" slug="music-bought-may-11" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Music Bought: May ’11</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Usually I post on Twitter a list of the music I buy each month, but this month I bought more than usual, so the blog is a better place.

  &lt;p&gt;“When the player is given choice, or at least the illusion of it, it’s very hard to have a narrator who is able to deceive the player: at best, you’re telling the player that those choices he or she made didn’t actually matter.” — &lt;a href="http://criticalmissive.blogspot.com/2011/04/wait-thats-not-what-happened-discussion.html"&gt;Critical Missive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Eric Schwarz just misses a key point in his essay, which is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; unreliable narration—and in fact any narration—isn’t a good fit for games. It’s more fundamental than just dismissing the player’s choices. Eric mentions &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&lt;/em&gt;, which should have been a big clue: the role of narrator in games is already occupied by the player, who by the use of savegames and the like is already deciding which of his choices matter, like an author rewriting a chapter of a book. When the Prince says, “no, that’s not right, let me tell it again,” he is only vocalising the player’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing a narrator already requires the player to trust the designer’s intentions, but an unreliable narrator breaks that trust as the designer attempts to usurp the player’s role. The player and the designer co-operate in the creation of the world/the play experience/the fabula (call it what you will), but the designer is there on the player’s sufferance. The player can at any point decide to metagame, or cheat the game, or just stop playing. As game designers crafting worlds, we are like gods—but subservient gods.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>game design</tag><tag>games</tag></post><post id="4630629794" url="https://backslashn.com/post/4630629794" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/4630629794/if-youre-thinking-about-which-platform-to-target" type="quote" date-gmt="2011-04-15 11:01:33 GMT" date="Fri, 15 Apr 2011 12:01:33" unix-timestamp="1302865293" format="markdown" reblog-key="qJpIVZKx" slug="if-youre-thinking-about-which-platform-to-target" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><quote-text>If you’re thinking about [which platform to target your game at] just in terms of where you can make the most money, I recommend the financial industry.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two favorite aspects. First, when you tap a tweet in your timeline, it gets selected and a bar of buttons to act on the tweet appears beneath it. Most Twitter clients, when you tap a tweet, present that tweet in a standalone view, sliding over to the right. With Tweetbot’s inline action bar, you can do something like replying or marking as a favorite and then immediately go back to scrolling the list of tweets — no need to tap a “Back” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Second — and this is the feature that’s proven the most addictive for me — is that you can slide left-to-right on any tweet to get a conversation thread of tweets. I.e., if a tweet is a reply to some other tweet, sliding left-to-right on it shows you a thread of all tweets in that reply chain. All popular Twitter clients have this sort of “conversation view” feature, but only Tweetbot lets you access it with a single gesture in your timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the conventions that Apple’s iPhone apps established for table views are tap-for-detail and swipe-to-delete (or rather, to reveal a delete button). In the official &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8"&gt;Twitter for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; app, Loren Brichter followed the first of these, but expanded on the latter so that a swipe would reveal buttons to reply, retweet, and so on&lt;a href="#fn1" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:80%;"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This swipe-for-actions gesture was to me a very natural expansion of the original semantics, and one which I’m disappointed has not seen further uptake. Instead, I’ve seen a number of strange meanings imparted to the swipe. &lt;a href="http://reederapp.com/"&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; comes to mind, as it coöpts swipe to mean ‘mark as read’ or ‘mark as unread’&lt;a href="#fn2" style="vertical-align:super;font-size:80%;"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my initial reaction to these gestures in Tweetbot—before I’ve tried it, mind you—is that they’re strange: the opposite of the guidelines Apple has established and recommended. But they are after all only guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fn1" style="font-size:80%;"&gt;1. Interestingly, this does not include a delete button even on your own tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fn2" style="font-size:80%;"&gt;2. Reeder also fails to provide very visible feedback on either of these actions—a slight change in text contrast and a very small icon change is all you see.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="4463223253" url="https://backslashn.com/post/4463223253" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/4463223253/minigames1" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-04-09 10:02:35 GMT" date="Sat, 09 Apr 2011 11:02:35" unix-timestamp="1302343355" format="markdown" reblog-key="x2VUKeK9" slug="minigames1" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s what’s wrong with minigames in general: they’re an interruption. You have to mentally shelve what you’re doing in the game to focus on the minigame, and all too often it’ll require deliberate analytical thought, which is a great way to completely lose track of what you were doing before it. You want to open that chest to get the lovely, lovely loot inside, and you have to do it quickly because there’s a goblin close behind you, and what if the loot’s too heavy, will you be able to carry it? Minigames kick you out of that flow state where you’re focussed on the game and your goals and force you to pay attention to some little annoying puzzle. Like a small boy jumping up and down screaming for attention so you can’t ignore him, and when you look at him you find he’s actually a sliding blocks puzzle, or a pipemania clone.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="4106396011" url="https://backslashn.com/post/4106396011" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/4106396011/escherisch" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-03-26 13:10:40 GMT" date="Sat, 26 Mar 2011 13:10:40" unix-timestamp="1301145040" format="markdown" reblog-key="81TXhdBs" slug="escherisch" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Escherisch</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://forums.mapcore.net/viewtopic.php?f=57&amp;amp;t=16032"&gt;Mapcore&amp;rsquo;s cube challenge&lt;/a&gt;,
I built a Half-Life 2 Episode Two map. It had to be constrained to 1024x1024x1024
units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically when confronted with an arbitrary constraint, I try to find a way to
work around it. For example, a TF2maps mini-contest challenged us to build a
control point in 2048x2048 units (no height limit), but without a 3D skybox. So
I built the point, and a huge window out of which you could see stars, and a
large spinning Earth. It looked like the Earth was in a 3D skybox, but in fact
it was a complicated fake involving texture proxies&amp;ndash;and was a great learning
exercise for me; texture proxies are surprisingly powerful in Source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/velvetfistironglove/4201887880/" title="Space Fortress 2 by velvetfistironglove, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2776/4201887880_b8d3357228_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="Space Fortress 2"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original idea for the mapcore challenge was to make the map appear to be
larger than 1024^3. For example, the starting room was going to be the
interior of a room that appeared to be about 2048 units long. You would be able
to walk around the entire room, and thus apparently be in a larger level. To do
this (and similar tricks), I was going to segment the vertical space into
stacked slices, each 128 or 256 units high, and duplicated the room geometry
into two of these slices; each having one half of the room within the 1024^3
cube. And I&amp;rsquo;d use a trigger_teleport to transport the player between each half,
thus making it appear to be a single continuous space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was certainly doable, but would have been a pretty boring space. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
really have any clear idea what I would do with the space beyond this illusion.
So casting around for inspiration, I ran across Escher&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Ascending and Descending&lt;/em&gt;
again. This time I noticed not the endless staircase illusion, but the surrounding
architecture: low sloped roofs, flat roofs, arches, stairways. I quickly got
the vision of a small village, with small passageways, stairways onto roofs and
into basements, with teleports to make physically impossible connections
between them. So that is what I built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/velvetfistironglove/5560499091/" title="The town by velvetfistironglove, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5560499091_5ea6421c77_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="The town"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/571452/mapcore/escherisch2.zip"&gt;Download the map here&lt;/a&gt;.
Put it in your Steam folder, in the &lt;b&gt;steamapps/yourusername/half-life 2 episode two/ep2/maps&lt;/b&gt; subfolder, then run Episode 2 and launch the map by typing &lt;b&gt;map escherisch&lt;/b&gt; in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two impossible connections between the edges of the map at ground
level. The top of the tower can be reached, but the stairs inside it will not
take you there, though they are not a dead end. And one passageway will lead
you to the bridge visible in the background of the picture above. The bridge
itself is outside the 1024^3 playable area, but the player is not; the map
itself is used as its own 3D skybox at a 1:1 scale to make this illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key factors influence the look of this map. I found early on that I was
unable to get the precalculated radiosity lightmaps to match in both areas
around a teleport; this led to a noticeable shift in shadows or colours while
teleporting, breaking the illusion. So I went with a fullbright map&amp;ndash;or rather,
a map with only UnlitGeneric textures. So I detailed the map with 11 shades of
grey, applying them manually to provide the appearance of flat lighting, while
maintaining contrast between the visible shapes. That turned out to be quite an
interesting challenge, and very helpful in emphasizing the silhouettes of the
geometry that the player encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a last minute change, I added colour correction, shading all light grey tones
with a very faint, barely noticeable sepia, and all mid to dark grey tones with
a dull red. White and black remained untinted; I think the result ended up much
more attractive than the plain greys. However, I submitted the map in a rush,
as I had to leave early the next day, and forgot to include the colour
correction table. So while my screenshots showed the red tinting, those trying
out the map would unfortunately only see it in greyscale. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rise of peer-to-peer file sharing is not to my mind a simplistic reaction to a failure of a free market to capitalise upon new technologies, but also a broader reaction to a set of scales which are intended to be balanced being tipped firmly in one direction. In essence, the fact that a great many people have embraced illicit redistribution of copyright works is actually society turning around to government and creators and collectively stating, through action, “look, the way this system has ended up… we can’t work with this. it now fails to serve anybody’s interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what the solution is, but I do know that it’s not bigger and bigger sticks, and neither is it a free-for-all. Somewhere, there’s a sweet spot, and we need to find our way back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/nevali"&gt;Mo&lt;/a&gt; writes clearly and succinctly (in the way he’s annoyingly good at) about the imbalance of the current copyright situation, which is biased towards the private good of the proprietor and not the public good of society.&lt;/p&gt;

You see and hear the game world through the TV or computer screen and speakers, but the controller is special. The controller alone allows you to enter the game world and &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember learning to ride a bicycle? You sat on the saddle, gripping the wobbley handlebars and pushed the pedals around, while training wheels or a parent&amp;rsquo;s guiding hand kept the bike upright—necessarily, or the bike would fight you, trying to fall down and throw you to the ground. Over a few days or weeks, you kept trying to ride it, but continued to need assistance to not fall. Then, one day, it was different: the bike no longer tried to fall over, but stayed upright, balanced as you pedalled. Suddenly you &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; how to ride a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What caused this epiphany? In that instant, your brain accepted the bicycle not as something external to struggle against, but as a part of your body, a new strange limb with wheels. Your proprioception—the body’s sense of itself and where its parts are—enlarged to encompass the bike. As you cycle more, this sense continues to grow, until you are no longer aware of where you end and the bike begins. You feel the wheels against the road, not the vibrations of the handlebars in your hands. You instinctively know how fast to pedal, how far to lean, how hard to brake to make the bike do exactly what you want, with no more thought required than you need to reach out your hand and grasp something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same effect happens with the controller. Once you are familiar with the game and the controller, it is like the handlerbars and brake levers on the bike: invisible, unnoticeable when learned. You no longer have to think about which key to press, or how to push the analog sticks to perform your movements, you just act—and your avatar in the game acts in unison. You take on the form of the hollow polygonal shell, and become immersed in the other world, with rules familiar and strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this immersion is not perfect. Your connection to the game is damaged if the controller no longer works as you expect, and your avatar no longer moves with your actions. This can be a sudden shock, like the front wheel on your bike coming out of the forks and rolling away; or it can be a deeply confusing experience, in the same way that finding your right arm attached to your left shoulder, and your left arm to your right would be. (Can you imagine how freaky that would feel?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a difference in quality to the way you interact with a bicycle and the way you become fully immersed in a game. The bicycle extends your self. But the avatar in the game replaces your self. You sit, unmoving except for your fingers twitching over the buttons, your other motor functions suppressed just like they are when you are asleep and dreaming—a kind of game-induced atonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There’s a lot more I wanted to write about controls, especially in relation to immersion, but I realised my ideas needed to stew some more, and I need to read more to gain a broader perspective. If you know of any good critiques or analyses of controls in games, please let me know either &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/adurdin"&gt;on twitter&lt;/a&gt; or in the comments.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="3747181894" url="https://backslashn.com/post/3747181894" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/3747181894/authors-wont-stop-writing-to-feed-their-creative" type="quote" date-gmt="2011-03-09 19:44:49 GMT" date="Wed, 09 Mar 2011 19:44:49" unix-timestamp="1299699889" format="markdown" reblog-key="ooUIEOGp" slug="authors-wont-stop-writing-to-feed-their-creative" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><quote-text>Authors won’t stop writing (to feed their creative impulse), and they won’t stop trying to make money off of that writing (to feed the rest of them)—the end of mega-publishers won’t mean the end of people’s appetite for books.

  &lt;p&gt;We need to stand up to this, to say it’s not okay, to loudly point out that it uniquely punishes their customers while not affecting those who do not pay.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Large publishers have to prove to their shareholders that they’re attempting to “fight piracy” (a phrase as daft as professing that you’re about to “fight the sea”). So delighted businesses spring up, offering “solutions”, selling their own inexplicably expensive brand of redundant restrictions. The argument is so idiotic that it’s difficult to even have.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“We are putting in DRM to fight piracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“But your DRM is demonstrably only affecting legitimate customers, while doing nothing to prevent piracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“WE NEED TOUGHER DRM!”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a brilliant technique. When one side’s position is so astoundingly illogical and batshit insane, you might as well throw oranges at a duck as try to reason with them. But we’re locked into it. A multi-million dollar business relies on publishers being willing to continue the farce, and the ill-informed shareholders keep being told unevidenced nonsense of “billions of dollars in lost revenue” against all reason. Of course they want this fixed – this imaginary loss sounds terrifying to them. Which leaves those attempting to argue with both logic and a desire for fair treatment shouting at a particularly obstinate and ignorant wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That intent is flawed, anyway. It presumes that I can&amp;rsquo;t identify with a character who exists apart from me—all evidence of drama, literature, and even sporting events to the contrary—or it presumes that in the superposition of me the player onto the avatar, I would find it confusing to hear my adopted self speak words which I had not, until that moment, thought. Which is also false; each unfamiliar utterance of my avatar immediately adds to my understanding of the preexisting character, and in the moment that I hear it, becomes the thought of my avatar as he exists in my head. That is, after all, what the process of identifying with a character is: I construct a mental model of them that enables me to empathise with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is probably possible to have a truly characterless protagonist, who is entirely defined by my actions, but is it necessary, or even worthwhile? Even the crutch of amnesia—whereby every revelation of the world is equally new and strange to me and my avatar—presupposes a character and relationships that are merely forgotten. It is better just to write a coherent world with its characters, and leave the tension between the avatar&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and my ignorance to be resolved in due course as I play.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="2995144271" url="https://backslashn.com/post/2995144271" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/2995144271/teaching-the-player-how-to-play" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-01-29 16:50:00 GMT" date="Sat, 29 Jan 2011 16:50:00" unix-timestamp="1296319800" format="markdown" reblog-key="CqHkQhkc" slug="teaching-the-player-how-to-play" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Teaching the player how to play</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;When you introduce a new element to a game, you should instruct the player how to use it. You should design this instruction so that the player learns organically, without being aware of the teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how not to do this. In &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;, you kill enemies most effectively by slicing off their arms and legs with your ‘plasma cutter’, a gun-like cutting tool. The designers of the game wanted to ensure the player understood this, so they designed the first level to have the following sequence of items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the room where the player finds the plasma cutter, a message is scrawled on the wall above in blood: “Cut off their limbs”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the player picks up the plasma cutter, their HUD displays, “Shoot the limbs off of enemies for extra damage.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short way down the connecting hallway, the player can find an audio log; listening to it, the player hears a crew member excitedly saying, “Listen, forget about shooting them in the body, you gotta cut off the limbs.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few minutes later, the team leader contacts him on the radio. He says, “Shooting them in the body didn’t seem to work. Go for the limbs, dismember them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, as that message finishes, the player’s HUD displays another message, which he must press a button to dismiss:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISMEMBERMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Conserve ammo by dismembering enemy limbs and doing extra damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Cut off limbs to kill quickly&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Dismember enemies to slow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game design attempts to hammer the lesson into the player by repeating it five times in as many minutes. While this will no doubt work, it is far from elegant, and the constant repetition will annoy the player who understood it after the first or second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to how the level design in &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; teaches the player that zombies can be cut in half. In contrast to &lt;em&gt;Dead Space,&lt;/em&gt; this is not essential for the player to learn, being just a fun alternative to shooting them, burning them, or throwing large, blunt objects at them. Yet the level design goes to great lengths to teach this to the player in order to maximise their fun. The player will learn this organically as he progresses through the level.&lt;/p&gt;

Mosquitoes spread it, carrying infection from person to person as they feed, infecting hundreds of millions of people around the world each year. Each year it kills a million people, mostly children. And once you’re infected, it can lie dormant in your liver for years, almost impossible to eradicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Far Cry 2, the player character has malaria. Every now and again, the screen blurs and dims, ominous music sounds, and the player character begins to stagger, debilitated, barely able to walk or fire his gun. But a quick button press makes him swallow a couple of pills, and the fever subsides until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the game progresses, the fever recurs more often and more intensely. And the supply of medicine is finite: when it runs out, the only way to get more is by embarking on a mission for the underground, transporting forged passports that the refugees need to escape the country. In return, the refugees give you what little antimalarial medicine they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your life-saving passports for their life-saving medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, these refugees and the members of the underground are the only civilians that the player encounters in the game. Everyone else is a member of the APR or UFLL—two factions fighting a civil war—or a mercenary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of malaria as a mechanical element of the game is puzzling. Apart from providing a convenient reason for the player character passing out in the opening scenes and for him to be incapacitated when first meeting the arms dealer The Jackal, the infection serves no purpose within the game’s mechanical structure or plot. And the side quests to replenish the medicine supply are self-contained with no other influence on the game. It seems strange that a designer as thoughtful as Clint Hocking would introduce an element that serves only to annoy the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why malaria? Well, malaria is endemic to much of southern Africa, and 90% of deaths caused by the disease occur in these regions. It is as much a part of the landscape as the zebras and wildebeests that appear in Far Cry 2, so realism alone might explain its presence. But there’s a more significant purpose for including it: it’s there because it encapsulates the game’s narrative, a metaphor for the violence portrayed in the game—&lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/2580418186/the-player-the-villain"&gt;the violence that even infects the player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the game’s opening scene, The Jackal quotes from Nietszche, “A living being seeks above all to discharge its strength. Life itself is will to power. Nothing else matters.” This philosophy suggests that the player character’s actions are only a natural consequence of their life, denying that any moral judgement can be assigned to them. But the game ultimately rejects this philosophy—as does The Jackal in the end (though it is unclear why the arms dealer undergoes this a change of heart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final mission, the significance of the player’s malaria infection is laid out. The player encounters The Jackal again, who decries the violence between the two warring factions. He likens them to a disease that ravages the landscape, and cannot ever be completely wiped out. And that he as an arms dealer, and the player character as a mercenary are vectors for the disease, spreading it inevitably wherever they go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jackal then points out an immediate problem: large numbers of refugees are attempting to escape the violence, crossing the border nearby into the neighbouring country. But the border guards won’t let them through, and the APR and UFLL are approaching, intent on massacre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through his strangely new-found morals, The Jackal concludes that he has no choice but to aid the refugees. Nor does he give the player a real choice, because he needs help: one must dynamite the road to stop the troops, and the other must take a suitcase of diamonds and bribe the border guards to allow the refugees through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, he says, is the only way that the spread of the disease—violence—can be halted: containing it within the country, quarantining it from the civilians, and letting it run its course as the factions destroy each other. But that still leaves two sources of infection: himself, and the player character. Logically, they too must be destroyed. One will sacrifice himself setting off the dynamite, and the other, after bribing the guards, will shoot himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two agents that spread violence become the two pills to treat it. The Jackal’s and the player’s lives given to save the lives of thousands of refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s bullshit. From the beginning, the game casts the player character in the role of a villain, and gives the player no path to choose otherwise. Progression can only come by accepting missions for the two factions, spreading violence further. In the few encounters with civilians, the player’s weapons are automatically and forcibly holstered. Even in helping the refugees, the player is motivated by their character’s need for medicine. The game makes a moral judgement of the player in the only role it lets them play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time the player is presented with a moral choice, the decision is forcibly made for them. Halfway through the game, the player is asked to choose between trying to save their “buddies”—fellow mercenaries they’ve worked with, or some civilians under attack. The choice doesn’t matter: both the civilians and the buddies are killed either way. The game’s story must proceed as planned, and to hell with the player wanting to influence it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final choice is the worst. The Jackal asks the player character to choose: either set off the dynamite and die in the explosion (due to the lack of enough wire for remote detonation); or bribe the guards and commit suicide afterwards. The choice was obvious: my character was a mercenary. He was only listening to The Jackal’s absurd plan under duress. He’d take the diamonds, bribe the border guards, and leave the country to look for opportunities elsewhere. Yeah, he’d save some refugees along the way—nothing wrong with a bit of good karma—but there was no reason to shoot himself afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But upon reaching the border, the game takes control away from the player, and makes the decision for them. The guards are bribed, the refugees begin to pass over the border, the screen fades to black, and a single gunshot is heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a far cry from a satisfactory ending.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>far cry 2</tag></post><post id="2751241261" url="https://backslashn.com/post/2751241261" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/2751241261/does-googles-removal-of-h264-support-presage-the" type="regular" date-gmt="2011-01-15 00:12:02 GMT" date="Sat, 15 Jan 2011 00:12:02" unix-timestamp="1295050322" format="markdown" reblog-key="OlqX6UGN" slug="does-googles-removal-of-h264-support-presage-the" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Does Google’s removal of H.264 support presage the removal of H.264 &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; streams through YouTube in favour of only two options: WebM &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or whatever-codec through Flash?

&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of my detailed look at the user interface of Twitter for Mac. &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/2682092645/user-interface-design-in-twitter-for-mac-part-i"&gt;Part one is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5334295910/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5334295910_97041f08e8_o.png" alt="Twitter’s main window"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sidebar is a constant presence while navigating the app; except for composing tweets, all other everyday interactions are done through the pane on the right-hand side. Most of the time this will show the user’s timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the timeline is very clean, almost minimal. A simple single-column table with a near-invisible scrollbar. Each row shows a tweet, the tweeter’s handle and avatar, and how long ago the tweet was posted; the only other addition is an indication if it is a retweet. The time and retweet labels are both set in a small, very faint, very light font. Even for a user with average eyesight such as myself they lie on the edge of illegibility; when the retweeting user’s handle has a lot of adjacent verticals such as “neilinglis”, the result is mostly an unreadable smudge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text of the tweets is better. While set in a medium grey with tight leading, it remains very readable due to the clarity of Helvetica and the quality of type rendering under OS X. Links and twitter handles in the tweets are only set apart by being drawn in black&lt;a href="#fn1" style="font-size:80%; vertical-align: super;"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, a low-contrast difference from the remainder of the text. This decision favours the guiding principle of the app’s design—a focus on the tweets—over the more traditional blue for links. The value of this trade-off is arguable; however with the primary affordance reduced almost to invisibility, it is important that these links offer a secondary affordance to convey to the user that these remain clickable. Unfortunately they don’t; hovering over a link neither changes the colour of the link nor changes the mouse pointer into a hand, both well-established indications that an element is clickable. The only other visible indication that the links differ from normal text is the “http://” at the start of web links. It is quite feasible that a user might go a long time without realising that the twitter handles within tweets can also be clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tweet actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the mouse pointer hovers over a row, the time label is replaced with icon buttons to retweet, favourite, reply, or (if applicable) view the conversation the tweet is a part of. Three of these can be seen in the picture above, and all four in that below. The icons used for the first three of these buttons are well chosen: the ‘retweet’ icon replicates that used on the Twitter web site; the ‘favourite’ star and ‘reply’ arrow are both conventionally used with those meanings. The ‘view conversation’ button’s icon, a speech bubble, is reasonable on its own, but in the context of the app might be confusing, as a larger version of the same icon is used in the sidebar to mean “timeline”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most elements in the app, these buttons respond to being hovered. However the response is very strange. While the icons initially appear in a medium grey, hovering over any one of them not only leaves it unchanged—calling into question if it can after all be clicked—but fades the other icons to a light grey—which suggests to the user that they are disabled and unclickable. This is a bizarre decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the row is hovered, these buttons do not appear or disappear instantly, but use a short fade animation. If the mouse is moving slowly, this animation draws a little more attention to the change than if it was instantaneous, so that the user will be aware of these new elements. But the timing as the buttons fade out and the date fades back in is a little off. This is especially noticeable as the mouse moves rapidly over rows, as for example when mousing to the topmost row. The buttons disappear almost instantly, but the date fades in more slowly, leaving a short period in which the space is blank. This is perceptible as unwanted and distracting flicker that follows the mouse pointer’s vertical motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Context menu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-clicking on a tweet displays the following context menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5333680925/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5249/5333680925_ecdbd5211b_o.png" width="433" height="478" alt="Tweet context menu"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half the items in this menu are commonly performed actions, and clearly labelled, such as “Reply…”, “Copy Tweet”, and “View on Twitter.com”. The first three of these menu items sensibly replicate three of the four buttons described above; the fourth button is also replicated in this menu, but where the button is titled “View conversation”, the corresponding menu item here is title “In reply to @dannygreg…”. This is a poor choice of words because it does not describe the action that the app performs when this item is selected, whereas “View conversation” is a simple and clear description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The items in the final two sections are an interesting inclusion. The first four relate to the content of the tweet, repeating the hashtags and user handles referred to in the tweet (and will also repeat any links in the tweet). But they are poorly labelled, lacking any words to indicate what action selecting them will perform. Select the hashtag performs a search for that hashtag, and selecting one of the handles will show the list of that user’s recent tweets. Better labels would have been “Search ‘#shudder’” and “@dannygreg’s tweets” for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final item is always the handle of the tweet’s author. This suffers the same naming problem as the items above, and like the other handles selecting it displays the author’s recent tweets. However much higher up in the menu is another menu item, “User Details” which also displays the author’s recent tweets—although its name suggests it would display the author’s profile instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the naming, the inclusion of these two sections of items is a good choice, despite duplicating the links within the tweets; having the app’s actions available in a standard menu increases the discoverability and accessibility of the actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scroll bar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right-hand side of the tweet list contains a custom scrollbar. This is much narrower than the standard OS X scrollbar, and lacks its bright blue scroll handle, a visible track which the handle runs in, and the up/down buttons that normally accompany the scroll bar. This custom scrollbar mimics the appearance of the scroll indicator in iOS, but unlike it is interactive. The small handle can be dragged up and down to scroll, and clicking on the edge of the window above or below it will scroll up or down a whole page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard scrollbars in OS X when clicked above or below the handle will similarly scroll up or down a page, but they also support an alternate mode: when clicked with the Option (Alt) key pressed, they scroll immediately to the corresponding position in the list or document. In addition OS X provides a setting in the System Preferences to swap these behaviours, so the immediate scrolling occurs with a bare click, and the page scrolling when Option is pressed. Twitter for Mac does not support the immediate scrolling at all: clicking or Option-clicking in its scroll bar always scrolls a whole page, regardless of the setting in System Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scroll handle seen above is at its smallest height. When the app is displaying few tweets as will occur shortly after launch, the handle is larger and makes an easier target; but after running for a while, the influx of new tweets will extend the list and cause the handle to shrink proportionally. In practice this means that the handle will be at this minimum size most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the scroll handle is an exceptionally small target. Making this worse is that the width of the handle that detects clicks is narrower than the invisible scroll track. If a click misses the handle by one or two pixels on either side, the click is picked up by the scroll track instead, and interpreted as a command to scroll a whole page up or down. While this is clearly a bug and not a design decision, together with the lack of Option-click support it demonstrates the level of detail that needs to be considered when creating custom UI to replace standard UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resize handle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little needs to be said regarding the resize handle in the lower-right corner. Despite its faintness and unconventional appearance, its shape and position are sufficient to convey its purpose and use in resizing the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Writing tweets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a tweet is done in a separate, small popup window. This window is also designed to be minimal. It contains the user’s avatar, a text field for writing the text; a Tweet button to post it and a Cancel button to discard it; and a small counter in light grey to indicate how many letters remain before the 140 character limit is reached, that turns orange and shows a negative number if that limit is exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5333681303/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5281/5333681303_1e21c1e19a_o.png" width="353" height="160" alt="The compose window"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the tweet to exceed the character limit while it is being composed is good; it gives the user the freedom to write whatever they wish and edit it down to size. In addition, Twitter for Mac will automatically shorten any links typed or pasted into the tweet; these are shown in full while composing, but the character counter accounts for the shortened version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving this window is, like the main window, done by dragging the black bar, located here along the bottom rather than the side. Unlike the main window, which can be moved by dragging anywhere including the buttons, here the window only moves if dragged between the buttons. This is once again nonstandard and hidden behaviour, but is less problematic here: the user has less reason to move the compose window, as it opens conveniently located beside the main window, and it is generally used only for a short time while writing a tweet. In Tweetie, the compose window had a standard title bar with traffic lights, and some users would compose draft tweets and minimise them until they were ready to post them, but the lack of traffic light buttons in Twitter’s compose window renders this impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The avatar indicates which account the tweet will be posted from. If the user has multiple accounts, this is important to know. This avatar also contains a hidden shortcut: clicking it displays a menu allowing the user to change the account they will post from. Hidden UI like this is problematic if it is the only way to access a feature, but this one is fine as it just provides a convenient shortcut; the user could instead copy the text, select the other account in the main window, and paste the text into a new compose window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5334296574/" title="Twitter: compose dropdown by adurdin, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5334296574_e1f51af6d7_o.png" width="353" height="184" alt="The account dropdown"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compose window shows a great piece of design when replying to another tweet. Instead of appearing beside the main window near the top, the compose window opens partially overlapping it, at the same height as the tweet that the user is replying to. And the window gains a small triangular arrowhead pointing back to that tweet. This reinforces the “replying” concept, and makes it easy for the user to refer to the original tweet while writing their reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5333680787/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5333680787_5239fdc7f6_o.png" width="747" height="372" alt="Composing a reply"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the launch of the Mac App Store last week, the long-awaited Tweetie 2, a.k.a. Twitter for the Mac was relased. As with his previous apps, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lorenb"&gt;Loren Brichter&lt;/a&gt; has employed many custom user interface elements. In the past, his willingness to experiment with UI has led to several usable and intuitive innovations. While the Twitter app shows evidence of a bold and well planned design, a lack of thorough consideration of details has led to many places where established usability principles and interface conventions are compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5334295910/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5334295910_97041f08e8_o.png" alt="Twitter’s main window"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter’s main window has a striking new appearance. Every element here is designed to give prominence to the tweets, which is what the app is primarily about. Everything else is there to manipulate the tweets or the app itself. To this end, the user interface has been pared down and subdued, and the only high-contrast elements visible are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tweets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tweeter’s name and avatar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The avatar of the user’s selected account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The icon of the selected page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Title bar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable omission in the window’s design is the title bar. In standard windows, the title bar serves three purposes: it displays the title of the document or app, it contains the “traffic light” buttons to close, minimise, and zoom the window, and it allows the user to move the window around the screen. The Twitter app’s window, as focused and distinctive as it is, does not need to display a title, and so omits the title bar. It still retains the traffic lights. But in removing the title bar, it has lost the affordance for moving the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an unreasonable decision: an app like Twitter will be placed to one side or the other of the screen and rarely moved again. A title bar would be wasted space for most of the time app’s life; so its removal it is bold yet justifiable. There is one problem: when the app is first launched, the window appears in the middle of the screen. This immediately presents the user with a problem: he wants to move the window to his preferred corner, yet the window presents no obvious way to move it. Eventually, trial and error will lead the user to discover that dragging in the black sidebar (even one of the icons in it) will move the window. But it is a definite mistake when the first thing an app does is present the user with a problem and give them no hint at a solution. If you create a custom user interface, you must be prepared to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could this be improved? Firstly, the app should avoid the problem in the first place. It should make an initial decision about the window’s position, opening by default on the left- or right-hand edge of the screen, so the user will only need to move it if the default does not suit his preference. Secondly, the app should present a perceived affordance for moving the window.  In earlier versions of Mac OS, it was common to use parallel lines or a texture of dots to indicate a draggable element, reminiscent of the textures used on tool handles to increase grip. This survives in the current OS only in the resize handles in the Dock and the lower-right corner of a window, so its continued applicability as an affordance for dragging may be questioned; but it does not at least suggest any other action. A light texture of dots on the blank area of the sidebar would, I believe, help indicate that it can be dragged to move the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Traffic lights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the title bar has gone, the “traffic light” buttons remain, allowing the user to close or minimise the window. They are slightly smaller and closer together than the usual, and instead of being red, yellow, green, they are all black to reduce their prominence and keep the focus on the tweets. But their position, shape, and shiny appearance leave no doubt of their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5333681123/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5333681123_792f583003_o.png" alt="Traffic lights"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, two small faults here. On the left is the traffic lights as they appear normally, and on the right the appearance when the mouse pointer hovers over them. The buttons are so dark that there is barely any contrast between them and the close, minimise, and zoom symbols that appear on hover. To fix this, the buttons should become lighter on hover, improving the contrast. The second fault is this: the Twitter app does not support zooming the window, yet the zoom button appears identical to the other buttons; worse, it also reacts visually to hovering and clicking, while performing no action at all. Compare this to the zoom button in System Preferences, which remains in a disabled appearance at all times. The normal disabled appearance of traffic light buttons is identical to their appearance when the app is inactive; when Twitter is inactive, the traffic light buttons become duller and darker in appearance, so the zoom button should have this appearance at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sidebar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elements in the sidebar allow the user to select between multiple Twitter accounts, and to move between different pages for each account: timeline, mentions, messages, lists, profile, and search. The account buttons show the avatars for each account, and behave in an accordion fashion. The page icons are shown below selected account avatar, and the other avatars are dimmed. Similarly, the selected page icon is shown in bright blue, and the icons for other pages have a dim gradient. It is worth noting that this gradient is darkest in the middle, and lighter at the top and bottom edges, keeping the icons subdued but providing better contrast at the edges, helping the shape to stand out from the background. The icon shapes are well differentiated, and with the exception of “lists” the icons use well-established symbols corresponding to their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking a different account avatar animates the sidebar between the two: the previously selected avatar fades to a dim appearance, and its page icons fade out and slide into it. This happens simultaneously with the clicked avatar moving up and brightening and its page icons appearing and sliding out of it. This is a great use of animation, and reinforces that the page icons belong to the avatar button above them. But the animation that happens to the tweet list while this happens is the same as the animation that occurs as you switch between different pages in the same account: the new page slides in from the left side over the top of the tweet list. Here, watch it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="419" height="682" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;amp;photo_secret=c2053863fe&amp;amp;photo_id=5334292554"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;amp;photo_secret=c2053863fe&amp;amp;photo_id=5334292554" height="682" width="419"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This horizontal animation is at odds with the vertically oriented icons, which muddles the model the app is trying to establish. In addition, the animation remains the same even if you are switching back and forth between two pages, although the “slide over” animation sets up the expectation of a “slide back off” animation when returning to the previous page. In both these aspects, Tweetie’s animation was better, reinforcing the vertical orientation and remaining consistent when switching back and forth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="419" height="682" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"&gt; &lt;param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;amp;photo_secret=830ed0571c&amp;amp;photo_id=5334283380"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;amp;photo_secret=830ed0571c&amp;amp;photo_id=5334283380" height="682" width="419"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clicking a dimmed icon or avatar selects it. Clicking the selected avatar or the selected page icon has an unexpected behaviour: the tweet list scrolls to the top. But this is not implemented consistently; only the timeline and mentions icons do this; the others do not. Nor does this behaviour work in the icons for a user&amp;rsquo;s tweets or favourites in their profile page. This inconsistency may cause occasional confusion for the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hover over an icon in the sidebar for a brief moment and a label for it will animate fading in and sliding a short way horizontally. This label does not appear instantaneously like the labels for applications in the Dock, but it appears much more quickly and in a different style than is established for tooltips in the operating system. This means that the label will often appear, unwanted, if the mouse is merely moved a little slowly across the icon, and the superfluous animation draws attention to it unnecessarily. Oddly, Twitter employs the system standard tooltips in other places, for example the icons to switch between different pages in a user’s profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, dragging in the sidebar will move the whole window. This is true even if you click and drag one of the avatars or icons in the sidebar, so the app has to distinguish between a simple click and the start of a drag. Because a mouse is very easy to accidentally nudge while clicking, a small “dead zone” is conventionally employed to distinguish the two: if the mouse pointer is moved more than five or so pixels away from where the click began, it’s safe to assume the user intended to begin a drag. But if the mouse pointer remains in the area, the action is a click. Twitter’s sidebar has a very small dead zone when distinguishing clicks from drags: if the mouse moves more than two pixels during the click, it is interpreted as a drag&lt;a href="#fn1" style="font-size:80%; vertical-align: super;"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. In consequence the user very easily ends up moving the window a few pixels when he intended only to click on an icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the app has downloaded tweets or messages that the user has not read yet, it indicates this with a small glowing blue indicator beside the icon for the page or the button for the account if it is not the selected account. But the indicator for unread tweets on unselected accounts is very small, and does not stand out beside the bright background of the tweet list as it should. If you compare Twitter’s indicators with those in  Tweetie, you can see that the latter stand out much more visibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/5341873427/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5341873427_5a18eba70b_o.png" alt="Status indicators"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly hidden at the bottom of the sidebar is a very small, faint icon of a bird (the Twitter logo), which displays a drop-down menu when clicked. By the icon’s placement and lack of prominence, I initially assumed it was for unimportant actions like displaying the About window. But instead it displays the menu for creating new tweets, one of the core features of the app. Due to its importance, this button should be larger and more prominent so that it is easier to point to with the mouse. It would also be much more obvious if it’s icon were a plus sign, an established convention meaning “New &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;” instead of the company’s logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fn1" style="font-size: 80%;"&gt;1. This sentence originally read, “Twitter’s sidebar fails to employ a dead zone when distinguishing clicks from drags.” I have corrected after more careful testing showed it to be incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequence: Retailers sell those games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result: Customers buy the games. Publishers and retailers profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people pirate those games for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers, dissatisfied or finished with the games, trade them back in to retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retailers resell the trade-ins for a slight markdown and generous profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers use the savings from trade-ins to buy their next game; retailers thus get reduced profit from these purchases, but publishers still get full profit. The retailer has made back their reduced profit on the new game in the sale of the trade-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishers get upset at piracy, and introduce various protection measures to try to prevent the games being transferred by the original customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pirates crack the protection measures, and continue to get the games for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers, unable to trade in their old games, purchase fewer games. Retailers and publishers make less profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retailers, unable to buy and resell trade ins, suffer decreased revenue on lifetime sales of these protected games. As shelf space is their most expensive resource, they in turn commit less shelf space to protected games to make up for the lost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers, with the protected games less visible, buy them less. Retailers and publishers make less profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some bright spark decides to start an online retail business and sells games online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers buy games online instead of at retail. Publishers and online retailers profit. Offline retails earn less revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offline retailers, faced with competition from online, push trade-ins harder to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers buy more trade-ins. Retailers profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishers, seeing dropping revenues and the still large profits the retailers make on non-protected trade-ins (but failing to see any connection), use protected DLC and unlockables to make non-protected game trade-ins less attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pirates crack the protection measures on the DLC and unlockables, and get the games and these extra bits for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers become more price sensitive to the less attractive game trade-ins, buy them less. Retailers make less profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers, unable to trade in their old games for as much, purchase fewer games. Retailers and publishers make less profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retailers, seeing lower lifetime revenues on the less attractive games, devote less shelf space to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers, with the less attractive games less visible, buy them less. Retailers and publishers make less profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bioshock famously built the cornerstone of its plot on the deconstruction of the designer/player relationship. It recognised that in a linear narrative, the player unwittingly (but willingly) acts as the agent of the designer in order to progress. Every significant action that the player takes is one that the designer planned out for them, and indeed led them into through careful artifice. Part way through the game, it is revealed that the player character has not been making free choices, but only acting in response to another&amp;rsquo;s prompting “Would you kindly…?”—just as the player responds to the voice of the designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Far Cry 2, the player character is a mercenary, sent to a small African nation beset by civil war to assassinate “The Jackal”, an arms dealer who is exploiting and furthering the conflict by supplying weapons to both sides. The idea is that this targetted assassination will help the people of the nation by reducing the ability of the rival factions to conduct the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Bioshock, Far Cry 2 builds its plot on a deconstructionist approach. It&amp;rsquo;s often been noted that the “heroes” of first-person shooters are less heroic (when evaluated in the light of their actions) than most of their opponents, being instead bloodthirsty killers responsible for the death of almost every mortal character they encounter. This is usually discussed with humorous intent, as killing is understood as a fundamental and necessary part of the first-person shooter (the hint being in the name).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this theme is taken seriously in Far Cry 2, and developed as the game progresses in the player&amp;rsquo;s actions and missions. The player character begins with the relatively noble aim of helping the country by removing The Jackal. In exchange for a lead on the The Jackal&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, the player character initially agrees to perform a mission for one of the two warring factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the game continues on, the player character takes on more missions for both factions, playing both sides against the other and furthering the war in exchange for his own personal profit in uncut diamonds. Such missions are a secret known only to the local leader of the corresponding faction; consequently almost every other person the player character encounters is a hostile enemy, and so the player ends up killing almost every other person he encounters, building up an in-game reputation for ruthlessness. Later in the game, the player will even assassinate the leaders of each faction and replace them with those of his own choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the player is the most evil character in the game, worse even than the warlords he works for. The standard first-person shooter mechanics reinforce this narrative. Regardless of the your intentions at the beginning, in Far Cry 2 you are the bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="2512213483" url="https://backslashn.com/post/2512213483" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/2512213483/an-ipad-game-made-in-24-hours" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-12-29 13:59:48 GMT" date="Wed, 29 Dec 2010 13:59:48" unix-timestamp="1293631188" format="markdown" reblog-key="7pVwzmT7" slug="an-ipad-game-made-in-24-hours" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>An iPad game made in 24 hours</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;The challenge: build a game in 24 hours. About a week ago, two internet-friends of mine, Tom Pritchard and Frazer Grant decided they would challenge themselves to build a game in 24 hours:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_le702uSGBz1qzlvtz.png" alt="The challenge"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom built a &lt;a href="http://tom-pritchard.co.uk/stuff/jimmychristmas/"&gt;simple platformer&lt;/a&gt;, and Frazer built the core of a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o27OE3ALH9s"&gt;side-scrolling shmup&lt;/a&gt;, which he &lt;a href="http://midget31394.tumblr.com/post/2444498615/24-hour-game-post-mortem"&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; on his blog. They both tweeted their progress as they were going, using the &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2324hourgame"&gt;#24hourgame hashtag&lt;/a&gt;, and since I follow both of them on twitter, I was inspired to take the same challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began at 11:00 on Monday, with a cup of tea—the best way to begin any project. I also decided to try using a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt; to manage my time and ensure I took enough (but not too many) breaks. I already had a basic concept in mind; a couple of weeks before I’d slapped together a prototype in UIKit to test out a possible multitouch control style for a top-down tactical shooter on the iPad, using line drawing for movement. This time around, I wanted to see how I could build a game in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but with controls designed for a touchscreen (I don’t consider the “virtual analog stick” that many iOS games use to be at all suitable for touch input).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game would have you controlling a policeman, using various non-lethal weapons to control a crowd of unarmed student protestors. You&amp;rsquo;d use two fingers for input: one finger dragged around the screen would control movement, with your character always walking directly toward your finger. A second finger tapped on the screen would fire your current weapon. You could fire in any direction, not just the direction you were currently moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew from the beginning that I’d use &lt;a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/"&gt;cocos2d&lt;/a&gt; to build the game. It provided me with the basics of a game engine, giving me the code to manage sprites, sounds, and so on. It also comes bundled with &lt;a href="http://www.box2d.org/"&gt;Box2D&lt;/a&gt;, a 2D physics engine, whose API I now have quite an animosity toward—although it did most of what I needed in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My progress can be seen best by searching for &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2324hourgame"&gt;#24hourgame on twitter &lt;/a&gt;. After six hours had elapsed, I had the player input working, together with some basic enemies, who always walked directly toward the player character. But at this point, neither you nor the enemies could hurt each other. Instead, they just mobbed about you, like groupies around a rock star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost four more hours, you could shoot the enemies, although they could not yet hurt you. I grabbed my tripod, set it up as short as possible on my desk, with my iPhone held to it by rubber bands, and made a short video of the game as it was so far (you can faintly hear in the background &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S1WBP91YKA"&gt;“Celebration Guns” by Stars&lt;/a&gt; that was playing in iTunes at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Oz6OxOCSx3s?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Oz6OxOCSx3s?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took an extra hour break to have some dinner and upload that video, and planned to do some graphics when I resumed working.  It was during this break that I realised the original plan would have to change. Doing graphics or animations for humans from a top down perspective that I’d be happy with was way beyond my drawing capabilities. So instead I decided at this point that I&amp;rsquo;d make the game about a spaceship shooting other spaceships. It lacked the political overtones that the original idea had, but solved the graphics problem for me—and also the sound effects problem. You have this decision to thank for the sound effects not being me making a bunch of pain noises into my headset mic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began with some HUD graphics, and built a working HUD for the player&amp;rsquo;s health and ammo, and drew an enemy spaceship. Next on my list was music and sound effects. I knew if I left them until late that I&amp;rsquo;d probably never do them. I created a number of retro sound effects with &lt;a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html"&gt;Tomas Pettersson’s SFXR&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sfxr/id349840825?mt=8"&gt;free iPhone port&lt;/a&gt; that Chris Grassib made. That meant I was hearing the sound effects through the iPad speaker, exactly as they would sound in-game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music I knew would be beyond my capabilities, so I would need to find some somewhere that I could use. Someone on twitter suggested I search soundcloud.com for creative commons licenced music, and sure enough, I found something I liked within a few minutes. Three tunes by &lt;a href="http://stad400.burningdarkness.de/"&gt;“STA$D400” Sven Hendriks&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/stad400/sta-d400-machine-code"&gt;Machine Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/stad400/sta-d400-argon"&gt;Argon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/stad400/sta-d400-weirdometer"&gt;Weirdometer&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn’t decide which of the three I liked best, so I put all three in; which one you get when playing is chosen randomly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now 3am. I needed more art, so I drew a player sprite, some explosion sprites, and one sprite for a second, faster and tougher enemy. You can&amp;rsquo;t see them very well in the video below, so I&amp;rsquo;ll reproduce them here in all their programmer art glory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_le703m3X4T1qzlvtz.png" alt="I are a artist"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now added animation to the enemy sprites, and the animated explosion when they died. Animating sprites in Cocos2D turned out to be very unintuitive to me, and more complicated than I expected; animations are a significant part of almost every 2D game, so the fact that the framework didn’t make them trivial to incorporate took me by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also needed a starfield for background art. Rather than drawing a new one, I instead ripped off a skybox I drew last year for &lt;a href="http://forums.tf2maps.net/showthread.php?t=11253"&gt;one of my Team Fortress 2 maps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://forums.tf2maps.net/showthread.php?t=11194"&gt;This skybox&lt;/a&gt; had lots of stars, nebulae, and bright galaxies. I cropped out a suitable 1024x768 portion, and dropped that into the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were now only four hours left. The only things remaining on my must-do list were: making the player able to die, a game menu to return to after dying, and an icon. Other things I wanted to do if there was time were the second-level enemy, scoring, and health and weapon pickups. Cocos2D has some simple menu support built in, so I quickly put together some text in Photoshop in Bank Gothic and OCR A fonts and one of Photoshop’s stock gradients, and had the menu all done in about 15 minutes. The icon took a little longer, only because I had to look up again what different size icons were required for an iPad app. Then I took another break for an hour to cook and eat breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, I implemented scoring pretty quickly, and the second enemy was also very quick to build in, so I spent a bit of time tweaking when it would spawn and how fast it was. I now had only 45 minutes left before 11:00—which was not going to enough, I thought, to draw and code in the powerups and a second weapon. So I decided to call it done at this point. Instead, I used the time to do a second video. Since the first one had a very odd angle, this time I attached a wooden spoon to the tripod, then rubber banded the iphone to it. This meant the iphone could sit directly above the iPad, and capture it much better. You can see the result below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was completely stoked with what I’d managed to get done. When I started the project, I fully expected it to end up largely unplayable, with terrible art and likely no sound. Instead, the art is passable, and the sound effects and music really tie the game together.&lt;/p&gt;

It did make it easier to climb over.  The fuel storage tank rang brightly as he rapped his knuckles on it.  Empty.  Well, he’d have to look for petrol farther down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wall behind the tank caught his eye.  There on the cinderblocks, the same stencilled graffiti he’d seen in the canals.  Monkey, human, transhuman?  Sub-human, he thought.  The invaders were not an advancement of the species, but an abnegation of identity, reducing humanity to something less.  The graffiti seemed less propaganda now than satire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And beside it was… was it perhaps the artist himself?  Another human, in the same blue overalls; dead.  Shot through the head, his face no longer recognisable.  Had he stencilled the image on the wall in defiance? or in despair and final resignation, moments before shooting himself?  The corpse’s right arm lay outstretched, the revolver still in its open palm.  As if in offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He reached down and took it.  At least he could avenge the poor bastard with his own gun.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="1663761098" url="https://backslashn.com/post/1663761098" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/1663761098/zombophobe" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-11-24 00:35:43 GMT" date="Wed, 24 Nov 2010 00:35:43" unix-timestamp="1290558943" format="markdown" reblog-key="RjCrKU7D" slug="zombophobe" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Zombophobe</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;I am a zombophobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I step into the shoes of Garrett, the City&amp;rsquo;s most renowned thief, I am fearless.  I enter the heavily guarded mansions of the City&amp;rsquo;s upper crust with impunity, and leave with my pockets full of their wealth.  No patrolling swordsman or watchful archer daunts me; even the deadly mechanical beasts of the Mechanists fail to give me pause, for I am the master of stealth and shadows.  I come and go without them ever seeing me, a lightened purse or missing silver goblet the only evidence of my passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the zombies terrify me.  I will run past armed guards, but when a zombie is nearby I want only to cower in a dark corner, far away.  I have to force myself to creep slowly past, fearful of making the slightest noise that might alert them.  I hold my breath; irrationally, for they obviously cannot hear me, the player, breathing.  Yet I spend long minutes not daring to move, listening to the half-choked, wheezing moans of the zombies, always dreading the change in tone that signals they&amp;rsquo;ve seen me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s even worse when the zombies are dormant.  They appear to be inert corpses, but their horrible wheezing gives the lie to that.  If I walk too near, or make too much noise, they will rise, awkwardly, suddenly, sending me into panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for one night. I was playing the fourth mission, &lt;em&gt;Down in the Bonehoard&lt;/em&gt;, in the old catacombs full of both dead and undead.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, nor how, but that night the zombies held no terror for me.  I laughed at them, toyed with them.  I ran around them, mocking their clumsy shambling.  I hit them with my blackjack, which cannot knock them out, but merely enrages them.  And I led them, like a piper leading rats, into the fireball traps in the bonehoard.  The fireballs violently dismembered them, hurling body parts around the room. And I laughed again, and went in search of more zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my phobia remains.  Even now, when I see—or worse—hear a zombie, the old terror grips me again.  But for that one glorious fearless night, the zombies were my playthings.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s a glorified sequence of quicktime events that values spectacle over anything resembling gameplay. &lt;em&gt;Enslaved&lt;/em&gt; is like Eliza Deadlittle, the main character of &lt;em&gt;Pygmalion and Zombies&lt;/em&gt;. Sure, she moves nice and talks pretty (which is to say the animation is superb and the voice acting is better than average), but underneath she&amp;rsquo;s a rotting, empty shell, devoid of soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my considered opinion, formed after playing the demo. I say &amp;ldquo;considered&amp;rdquo;, because I played through the demo three times in all just to be sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t slagging it off unfairly. You might complain about me writing off the whole game based on just the demo, but if the demo isn&amp;rsquo;t representative of the best the game has to offer, then what&amp;rsquo;s the point of a demo at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening cutscene&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m generous: I&amp;rsquo;ll forgive a &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; for opening with a &lt;em&gt;cutscene&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;opens to show a futuristic flying slave ship, an improbably proportioned man with spiky hair and a neck wider than his head, trapped in a box, like Ico. Thankfully the cutscene here is shorter than the one that opens that game: after the inevitable series of explosions, the box falls to the ground and the man emerges.  Then you realise he&amp;rsquo;s the character you&amp;rsquo;re controlling. But controlling is too strong a word. Guiding. Toying with between the slides of this whole glorified Powerpoint presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take issue with saying you&amp;rsquo;re controlling the character, because the game changes the meaning of the buttons on the controller as the level design dictates, so you&amp;rsquo;re never in control. Initially the A button makes the man do a rolling leap in the direction of the left stick, but a little later on, when the character reaches a small gap in the floor, the game decides he should jump instead, so the A button makes him jump the gap. This is the first of this game&amp;rsquo;s sins: taking agency away from you by making the buttons inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second sin of this game is lying to you about the available actions. At the beginning of the level, the character is standing on an upper deck in the slave ship; a lower deck is visible below through the gratings in the floor. There are rents torn in the upper deck, and often gaps at the side between it and the walls, but walking towards the edges of such gaps you encounter invisible walls. But shortly after the first area, you encounter another, slightly larger gap in the deck. Only this time, instead of jumping over it, the A button makes you jump down to the lower deck, contradicting what the level taught you up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of these invisible walls, the game is guilty of ludonarrative dissonance. To all appearances, the slave ship is a hazardous environment, parts exploding around you, the ship even tearing in two and striking buildings during its long descent. But the environment is actually ludicrously safe. There are four ways to die: the first is by standing in fire, for &lt;em&gt;thirteen seconds&lt;/em&gt;. This is probably fair; fire is obviously hazardous, and this is clearly a tutorial level, so the fact that it kills you exceedingly slowly means it is forgiving to the player who has not mastered the analog sticks. The second way to die is when fighting the combat mechs, or rather by not fighting them. The third and fourth ways to die are by taking too long in two timed sections of the game (one of which is cleverly timed to make it seem as though you are always only just fast enough). The explosions are never a threat: they are all scripted to miss you (in fact, many of them are scripted to conveniently take out an enemy standing before you). As mentioned before, the invisible walls prevent you from falling to the floor below, so fall damage is not a threat. The ludicrous bit comes where you are out on the damaged wings of the craft, jumping from section to section and even from wing to wing. But you are still a thrall of the invisible walls: it is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to fall off the wings. Any appearance of danger is merely a device to &amp;ldquo;enhance&amp;rdquo; your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the climbing sections, in which you move from handhold to handhold by pressing A to jump. These sections highlight the poor visual design of the environments and the extreme linearity of the game. Despite there often being many protuberances visible on the sides of the damaged ship, the only ones that exist in the game space form a strictly linear path to the next section. And they flash. Every second, each handhold is highlighted with a white flash. This is only good because otherwise many of them would be impossible to distinguish from the similar-looking not-handholds nearby. But &lt;a href="http://usabilitymatters.net/?p=134"&gt;when you have to signpost your affordances&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve already failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the worst of all the sins of this game is this: it is not a game. The essential feature that distinguishes a game from other media is the &lt;a href="http://www.clicknothing.com/click_nothing/2010/10/agency-past-present-future.html"&gt;agency of the player&lt;/a&gt;. The player has choices, and those choices define the game. Sometimes the choice is between different paths through the level&amp;ndash;and overly linear levels are bad precisely because they remove agency. But in the entire Enslaved demo, I had only one choice. I do not count the four ways to die mentioned above, because a choice between the game ending and the game continuing is not really a meaningful choice at all. During the part of the level where you are jumping around the wings (about three quarters through the demo), several combat mechs come out onto the wings, looking to fight you. And here the game actually let me stop and fight them, or run past them and continue through the level. This choice had not been available previously: every fight up to this point had either been a forced tutorial that you had to fight to finish, or had been gated by a door that inexplicably unlocked itself just as you defeated the last enemy. That was my sole expression of agency in the game, the exception that proves the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it turns out that &lt;em&gt;Enslaved&lt;/em&gt; is a very apt title: every aspect of the game design serves to enforce the designer&amp;rsquo;s narrow conception. It is not your character who is enslaved, but you&amp;ndash;the player&amp;ndash;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="1326894093" url="https://backslashn.com/post/1326894093" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/1326894093/i-suspect-that-the-internet-is-here-to-stay-and" type="quote" date-gmt="2010-10-16 10:45:57 GMT" date="Sat, 16 Oct 2010 11:45:57" unix-timestamp="1287225957" format="markdown" reblog-key="kNewa7Jo" slug="i-suspect-that-the-internet-is-here-to-stay-and" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><quote-text>I suspect that the internet is here to stay (and you can quote me on that).</quote-text><quote-source> &lt;a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2005/10/18/wowie-zowie/"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt;</quote-source></post><post id="1221413877" url="https://backslashn.com/post/1221413877" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/1221413877/tumbled-logic-of-ads-and-blocking" type="link" date-gmt="2010-10-01 11:51:56 GMT" date="Fri, 01 Oct 2010 12:51:56" unix-timestamp="1285933916" format="markdown" reblog-key="JWMpPu1g" slug="tumbled-logic-of-ads-and-blocking" state="published" is_reblog="true" tumblelog="backslashn"><link-text>Tumbled Logic: Of ads and blocking</link-text><link-url>http://nevali.net/post/1221276299/of-ads-and-blocking</link-url><link-description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nevali.net/post/1221276299/of-ads-and-blocking" class="tumblr_blog"&gt;nevali&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, if the content publish industry wishes to preserve its pay-per-view revenue, it only has one choice: collectively apply pressure on the ad brokers and other sites who serve up ‘bad’ ads. As much as the publishers need the ads and their brokers, the brokers need the decent sites to place the ads on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as ads are served on a PPV/PPI or a PPC model, there will of course be ad brokers who try to maximise the views/impressions/clicks with underhanded techniques (pop-unders and the like), and willing ‘content publishers’ whose only interest is the ad revenue, so they build a site which is largely SEO content and ads, building traffic by exploiting web users as much as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are obviously not the “decent sites” that Mo is talking about, but they are part of the problem which will never self-regulate in the way suggested, because neither the broker nor the publisher has any incentive to do so. Decent sites, those that are trying to attract customers by offering value (and consequently care about their reputation) will—and to some extent already do—pressure their ad brokers to avoid bad ads. Partly because of the negative effect it has on their reputation, partly because their customers’ ad-blocking impacts their revenue, and partly because they receive complaints from their customers about bad ads. I wrote &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/709581385/on-advertising"&gt;some brief thoughts&lt;/a&gt; about these publishers a while back, but it&amp;rsquo;s largely tangential to Mo&amp;rsquo;s point here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, leaving aside the decent publishers, how do we deal with the bad ones? As I said, they have no incentive to change: abusing SEO techniques (as far as they can get away with it) gives them more exposure through search engine traffic. More exposure means more people view or click on the ads, which means more money for them, the ad brokers, and the other businesses employing the shady ad brokers to show their ads in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is broadly similar to that of spam email. One of the most effective techniques in fighting spam is filtering: email providers today deploy automated tools to detect and filter out spam email. But before filtering by the email provider became widespread, end users were using spam filtering tools built-in to their mail clients, or even third-party tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With bad ads, the ISPs and the search engines are both in a position to provide this kind of filtering on behalf of end users. Both often employ filtering for malware sites (and there is a not insignificant correlation between bad ads and sites promulgating malware unintentionally). I wouldn’t be surprised to see an enterprising search engine provider or ISP offer ‘bad ad’ blocking as part of their service in the near future, and I know that end users would find this attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t make the problem go away—spam email is still an enormous problem—but it provides the only real disincentive that I can see working: fewer eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;</link-description></post><post id="1155679268" url="https://backslashn.com/post/1155679268" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/1155679268/excerpt" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-09-20 12:38:52 GMT" date="Mon, 20 Sep 2010 13:38:52" unix-timestamp="1284986332" format="markdown" reblog-key="C64WQGpr" slug="excerpt" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Excerpt</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I like games,” I began, still smoking the HD cigarette. “I like &lt;em&gt;hic&lt;/em&gt; them a lot. Specifically, I like how consistently games can summon up emotions in me. That’s why I play them, I think. The element of &lt;em&gt;hic&lt;/em&gt; interactivity draws you into the experience, and once you’re in the experience it’s that much easier for you to become elated, excited, wounded or infuriated. When you’re playing a videogame, the successes, discoveries, and &lt;em&gt;hic&lt;/em&gt; relationships happening on the screen- they’re yours. Failures, losses, enemies- they’re yours too.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s like, we all know how engaging videogames are. A rapt kid with his eyes glued to a screen is still probably the defining image of videogaming. And yet nobody bothers reverse engineering this image- nobody asks why the game is engaging the kid so much. And the answer is, the game isn’t engaging the kid, the kid is engaging the game. The kid’s body seems lifeless because he isn’t in the room, he’s in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fumito Ueda obviously subscribes to the Lord of the Rings theory of winding up a story: take as long as possible.  After you defeat the final colossus (a great climax), there&amp;rsquo;s a full &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxKN77TSags"&gt;twenty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzE0lD8uQGw"&gt;five&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffqdukNjaus"&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt; of long drawn-out cutscenes before the game actually ends. But Lord of the Rings at least has the excuse of furthering the story of the characters you’ve come to know. This painfully slow-paced cutscene spends most of its time showing a bunch of riders (who you’ve only barely seen in one previous cutscene) coming to the temple and trying to kill you for your crimes (not sure whether it means past crimes or the slaying of the colossi). There are two sections here where you can move around, but they are very short, and actually designed to frustrate you more by preventing you from achieving what you are trying to! The whole ending cutscene is confusing and disappointing, like a bland, tasteless course of desserts after a fine meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are too many colossi—not in terms of game length, but a few of them just feel like repeats of the earlier ones. With the current material, I think they should have cut it down to 12 instead of 16 colossi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eleventh and fourteenth colossi—apart from not even being worthy of the term, being barely larger than a small elephant—were incredibly frustrating. When they charge at you, if you don’t dodge out of the way just in time, they will knock you down, and knock the breath out of you. Just as you begin to rise, the colossus will charge at you again, knocking you down once more. I &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; was able to dodge out of the way in the split second here between getting up and getting knocked down again, but died five or six times to this attack between the two colossi. It’s &lt;em&gt;amazingly&lt;/em&gt; frustrating, as there’s nothing you can do while the beast slowly kills you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse than the third is the tenth colossus. This one is a worm-like creature that moves through the sand—very much like a smaller version of a Sandworm from &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, except that you can’t ride it. To defeat it, you must first ride your horse at a gallop while it chases you. As it comes up behind you, you use your bow, and turn around on your horse to take aim at its eyes. So here you are, using the left analog stick to backwards on your horse which is at full speed—did I mention this is in a fairly small cavern? And that there are numerous boulders strewn around this cavern? And that while you’re aiming the bow, the left analog stick controls it instead of steering the horse? And since you have to look backwards, you wouldn’t be able see the obstacles even if you could dodge them? Yeah. And to top it all off, the movement of the creature’s head and of your horse makes it awkward to hit the eyes in the five to ten seconds you have (at best) available. This whole encounter &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; should have been cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the story—such as it is—sucks. What little is shown in the cutscenes is enough to feel vague in the way that a poor storyteller leaves a story vague. Unfocused. And irrelevant to the game. I think the game would have been far better if it had eschewed the story altogether, and just left you, the landscape, and the colossi—with your only interaction with them being to leave them alone, or to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="999692709" url="https://backslashn.com/post/999692709" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/999692709/shadow-of-the-colossus" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-08-23 20:55:19 GMT" date="Mon, 23 Aug 2010 21:55:19" unix-timestamp="1282596919" format="markdown" reblog-key="mDklQfX0" slug="shadow-of-the-colossus" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Shadow of the Colossus</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I bought a PS2. This year, I borrowed Shadow of the Colossus from a
friend. Yesterday, I played it. And now, I write about it. (There are spoilers
ahead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a stunningly beautiful game. As you go in search of the sixteen
colossi, you&amp;rsquo;ll travel over winding cliffside paths, through barren
sun-drenched deserts, and past thunderous waterfalls. Stand in a darkened
room, and light areas beyond bloom brilliantly, then fade to a normal
brightness as you walk into the light. Even the animations are beautiful; the
player’s character and the horse he rides are fluidly animated, and the
lizards that you find scuttling around the land move quickly and naturally
(annoyingly so when you’re trying to shoot them with your bow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heilemann/101345768/in/set-72057594066462882/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/41/101345768_ca78c3c3fb_z.jpg?zz=1" alt="The player rides by as a colossus erupts from the sand"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that all this is done on the PS2—now 10-year old hardware—is
stunning. If it weren’t for the lowish-resolution textures and that it’s not
HD, it wouldn’t look out of place among the current crop of games.
Occasionally the framerate drops, down to about 15fps at worst in my
estimation; unfortunate, but still playable. It’s fascinating reading about
&lt;a href="http://www.bruno-urbain.com/resources/making_of_sotc.pdf"&gt;the techniques the developers
used&lt;/a&gt; to achieve
these effects within the limits of the PS2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heilemann/101345812/in/set-72057594066462882/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/25/101345812_e5f979adc9_z.jpg?zz=1" alt="A quadruped colossus looks down at the player."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colossi are equally richly rendered, covered with rich fur and bony
protrusions, and later with stone armour. And they are huge. All but two
completely dwarf the player, making you feel as insignificant as Gulliver
among the Brobdingnagians. Each colossus needs you to take a different
approach to climb it and attack its weak spots. Yes, I’m afraid the destiny of
each colossus is the same: eventually each will die by your hand. It seems a
horrible waste, having to kill all these majestic creatures. Even after you
defeat them they continue inspire awe, their petrified husks sprawling across
the landscape, or forming a hill burgeoning with plant life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heilemann/101345593/in/set-72057594066462882/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/40/101345593_c83fdda471_z.jpg?zz=1" alt="The dried corpse of a colossus, now turned to stone, still dwarfs the player"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting the colossi is where this game really stands out. Some lurk
underwater, others stomp across the landscape, and two even fly. You have to
somehow climb up on them, grabbing onto their fur or armour, while finding and
stabbing their weak spots (which helpfully glow) with your sword. The climbing
is wonderfully done; the colossi move about as you climb, either through their
motion or trying to shake you off. As you walk about on their backs or
shoulders, you release your grip to run to another location—then quickly grab
back on again as the colossus begins to shake. I loved the controls here:
pressing the grab button tightly, I felt physically connected as the player
was hanging on for dear life, being thrown about by the movement of the
monster. I fear I might have worn out the R1 trigger on my controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heilemann/101344785/in/set-72057594066462882/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/35/101344785_32d1858222_z.jpg?zz=1" alt="The player is dazed by the attack of a colossus."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll end with my favourite part of the game: the thirteenth colossus. This is an enormous snake-like creature that flies through the air with flipper-like wings, assisted by gas sacs on its underside. As it comes near to the ground, its flippers touch the sand, throwing up billowing clouds of dust behind it. I urge my horse to its fastest gallop, chasing the colossus, riding around the rocky protuberances in the desert, and slowly drawing alongside its flippers, with the exhilaration of the classic chasing-the-train scenes from westerns. I leap from my horse to grab onto the flippers, then slowly climb along its ridges as the colossus soars back into the sky. Once I reached its back, now a hundred metres above the ground, it flies steadily enough for me to stand, and even run along the length of its sinuously twisting body, only grabbing on as it occasionally rolls and swoops. It’s absolutely thrilling, I don’t want it to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I must end it.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s what my iPhone Simulator looks like now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, the Home button is a little misaligned, because the actual button is too high, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like editing the nibs as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like your simulator to look sleek like this, grab &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/571452/blogfiles/iphonesimulatorframe/iPhone%204%20Simulator%20Frame.zip"&gt;this zip file&lt;/a&gt;.  Locate &lt;code&gt;iPhone Simulator.app&lt;/code&gt; in Finder, open up its &lt;code&gt;Resources&lt;/code&gt; directory, and extract the two PNGs from this zip into there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pi not sure if i like tumblr at least as a place to blog anyway. it lovely look most of the themes are pretty but there too many awkward nuances. comments system is irritating getting everything you want from one theme tough and some use don even allow change darkness font.&gt;&lt;/pi&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would never have actually started blogging without Tumblr. I had tried several times to start a blog with Wordpress or something else, but I just spent too much time faffing about with settings and themes and never got around to writing much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of comment support is also a benefit in the end. Comments require moderation, which requires time and effort. And comments for me would mostly be ego-stroking anyway. But Tumblr makes it easy to comment on another post, just like this. Only I&amp;rsquo;m not writing my words on your page, where they might (hypothetically) be offensive, or boring, or just stupid clutter, but on my own space. Which keeps the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only lack from having no comments is the lack of community. But building a community of commenters is hard, and keeping it sane and civil is harder yet. Better a forum with a team of moderators, I think.&lt;/p&gt;</link-description></post><post id="778474905" url="https://backslashn.com/post/778474905" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/778474905/a-completely-dark-carpeted-room-sheer-bliss" type="link" date-gmt="2010-07-06 22:32:00 GMT" date="Tue, 06 Jul 2010 23:32:00" unix-timestamp="1278455520" format="markdown" reblog-key="F1I4esO0" slug="a-completely-dark-carpeted-room-sheer-bliss" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><link-text>A completely dark carpeted room: sheer bliss!</link-text><link-url>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/retrospective-thief-the-dark-project-article</link-url><link-description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“After the light, the second most important aesthetic character in the game is the floor. Of how many games could you write that sentence? You’re always acutely aware of what you’re standing on. Tiled, stone floors make up most of the streets and buildings you encounter, loudly registering your clip-clop footsteps.… But then, there it is: carpet. Sweet, blessed carpet. On carpet Garrett can run, jump and be merry, producing nothing more than a soft scuffing. Sneaking up on the enemy is a cinch, picking their pockets and being long gone before they’ve a clue you were ever there. Oh, heavens, a completely dark carpeted room: sheer bliss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But moving from ad-free to ad-supported should be carefully considered. It changes your relationship with your readers at a fundamental level: because you are not merely selling space on your blog to the advertisers, you are actually selling a small portion of your readers&amp;rsquo; attention. You are beginnig to commercially exploit your visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing—it depends on the aims of the blog, the audience you are seeking, and the kind of relationship you are trying to build with the audience. But if the context is inappropriate, this may lead to your readers feeling used, or even offended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another oft-overlooked impact of advertising is how it changes your message. Many web-based advertising services exercise little editorial control over the ads they run, which results in disreputable ads all over the web, even on otherwise reputable sites. Since you are ultimately responsible for the content that appears on your site, you can end up appearing to endorse medically questionable diet pills, or whatever the cheap-scammy-ad-of-the-week is.

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see. The display on the iPhone 4 is the same height as that on the earlier model iPhones: 76mm. It has 960 rows of pixels. Therefore each pixel is 0.079mm high. With the iPhone held 250mm (10 inches) away from the eyes, each pixel is 2.arctan(0.079/250/2) == 1.1 minute of arc. According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the naked eye has a resolution of 1 to 2 minutes of arc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, a single row of pixels is still clearly visible from 10&amp;quot; on the iPhone 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I could have avoided the trig and just quoted Wikipedia: “Observing a nearby small object without a magnifying glass or a microscope, the usual distance is 20–25 cm. At this close range, 0.05 mm can be seen clearly”, but you know, maths is fun!&lt;/p&gt;</quote-source></post><post id="681013260" url="https://backslashn.com/post/681013260" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/681013260/tolerance-peers-over-a-wall-and-says-im-going-to" type="quote" date-gmt="2010-06-09 19:36:39 GMT" date="Wed, 09 Jun 2010 20:36:39" unix-timestamp="1276112199" format="markdown" reblog-key="Vnz1yn9M" slug="tolerance-peers-over-a-wall-and-says-im-going-to" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><quote-text>Tolerance peers over a wall and says “I’m going to keep my mouth shut.” That’s better than shooting, but it still confirms the importance of the wall.

&lt;p&gt;What a load of nonsense. On the iPad, you don&amp;rsquo;t interact directly with the content, no more than you do on a desktop or with paper documents.

  &lt;p&gt;It is only by turning away from our forebears’ rules that we can truly
  experience the richness that life can offer. A life that stays on the path
  ends at last with nothing of worth to show for it, either good or bad. But
  if we rebel, if we leave the straight path and stray into the darkness of
  the forests around, we can get a glimpse of the beauty, and the mystery,
  and the danger of the larger world.&lt;/p&gt;

A roundabout, rusted and lopsided, but it still turned, squealing, at a push. Beside it was a slippery-dip, the once smooth slide now pitted and corroded. This had once been a place of joy, where children played laughing in the sun. No longer. He half-fancied he could hear the echo of their laughter, as though the place itself held the memories of years long since gone. Or was it their screams he heard? The sound faded from his mind. No, the playground was only a reminder of a bitter truth: there were no children anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked down as his foot hit something on the ground. It was a triangular prism with a hole through the centre, two of three faces marked with an X and an O. He walked to the other side of the path, where an an abacus-like frame held eight more of the same objects, rotating on three axles. He remembered the game. Noughts and Crosses, they used to call it; an unwinnable game. Two people playing perfectly would always end with stalemate. He brought his mind back to the present situation&amp;ndash;was the same true of their current struggle? Did they really have a chance of beating their oppressors, destroying them? Or was the best outcome an endless stalemate, a constant struggle just to survive? That would almost be worse than losing outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He replaced the piece in the gap on the centre axle, and gently spun it. It stopped. There, along the diagonal from the bottom left to the top right, was a line of three X&amp;rsquo;s. A winning move. Perhaps there was hope after all? A smile came briefly to his lips as he left the playground and continued on.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="617075564" url="https://backslashn.com/post/617075564" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/617075564/live-music" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-05-20 20:51:06 GMT" date="Thu, 20 May 2010 21:51:06" unix-timestamp="1274388666" format="markdown" reblog-key="Gvo5st42" slug="live-music" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Live Music</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Last December I realised what a great place Edinburgh is for live music. Even apart from the Fringe, it’s a popular place for bands of all sizes. And Glasgow’s barely an hour away, too, and it also hosts many live music events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been to see quite a few gigs while here: &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM1Y7DqKeew"&gt;Jonathan Coulton&lt;/a&gt; on his first ever visit to Scotland (and again on his second visit); &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=110nVTF26-U"&gt;Emiliana Torrini&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu4qQKlyF7s"&gt;Death Cab for Cutie&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVCqaEz5HTo"&gt;My Friend the Chocolate Cake&lt;/a&gt;. But I found out about most of these by searching specifically for the band, and tour dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 8th last year, purely by coincidence, I found that &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijspl6rF7-I"&gt;Deerhoof&lt;/a&gt; were playing, that night, at The Bongo Club, just a few minutes walk from my flat. I’d recently discovered their album “Friend Opportunity”, and while it was still strange to me, I had liked what I’d heard. So I went to see them, and was blown away. No doubt it’s cliché to say so by now, but they were far more frenzied and energetic live than on the CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that serendipitous discovery set a little wheel turning in my head. I did nothing about it in January, but come February I decided to search for shows on that month. And was thrilled to find that &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPLy4-OgAw"&gt;Shearwater&lt;/a&gt; were playing in Glasgow on the 23rd of that month—another of my recent discoveries on eMusic, and I’d really loved what I’d heard; so I went to see them. And decided on a not-quite-New-Year’s resolution sort of thing: to see at least one live music gig each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March was &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89zzHCfZ_zs"&gt;MONO&lt;/a&gt;, an instrumental post-rock group from Japan. Unfortunately their live performance was a little disappointing, the usual lushness of their sound was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then promptly forgot my resolution for most of April. Typical. Towards the end of the month, I went searching again, and ended up deciding on two gigs in May: &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldWPknL4IU"&gt;Woodpigeon&lt;/a&gt; on the 2nd, and &lt;a href="http://quietube.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI0fA59-yG0"&gt;Mark Knopfler&lt;/a&gt;—tomorrow, in fact. I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s gig, and all the rest this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a wee plug: if you’re in Edinburgh or Glasgow, &lt;a href="http://www.rippedrecords.com/"&gt;Ripped Records&lt;/a&gt; (also on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rippedr"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is a great site (put together by a mate of mine, Matt Riggott) to find out about upcoming music events.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="614021059" url="https://backslashn.com/post/614021059" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/614021059/a-bit-closer-to-heaven" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-05-19 20:43:49 GMT" date="Wed, 19 May 2010 21:43:49" unix-timestamp="1274301829" format="markdown" reblog-key="wLCDrGr4" slug="a-bit-closer-to-heaven" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>A bit closer to Heaven.</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4622612448/" title="Max Triptych by adurdin, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4622612448_de20e03fa9.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="Max Triptych"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a landscape of poorly sketched video-game characters, Max Payne stands out. Maybe it’s because the strokes are broad, and the outlines so simple. Max has clarity, because he has one defining characteristic, one overriding emotion. Max Payne is &lt;em&gt;Revenge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game opens and closes with the same scene: Max, standing atop a skyscraper, rifle in hand, his revenge complete. &lt;i&gt;“They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was over.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tale of revenge is a natural fit for a game that, in its core mechanic, is all about shooting. Most of the game is a series of shooting galleries, in which you—as Max—kill innumerable goons and their bosses, ultimately uncovering the secret behind the murders and confronting the Big Bad at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4622006093/" title="Weather by adurdin, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4622006093_201ebc6a09.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="Weather"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violent weather provides a congruent backdrop to the game’s violence. New York’s worst recorded snowstorm begins as the game starts, and increases in intensity as Max hunts deeper into the underworld organisations. Max Payne is not just the protagonist of this story, he is the centre of it; even the weather exists only to reflect and amplify his emotion. When Max finally satisfies his revenge, the storm too is satisfied, and dies down. The snowstorm also resonates with the Norse myth of Ragnarök, the battle of the gods whose beginning is marked by three winters without a summer. And indeed elements from Norse myth are woven throughout the story, adding colour to the dingy New York setting: Æsir Plaza, Alfred Woden, Valkyr, Project Valhalla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interspersed with the shooting, the game’s story is laid out in a sequence of graphic novel pages, famously narrated with Max’s hard-boiled internal monologue. Both adored and derided by players, the writing walks just this side of noir parody—aware of its inherent absurdity, but always keeping a straight face. Maintaining this style consistently is not as easy as it seems, but the game’s writer, Sam Lake, manages it remarkably well. To the characters within the story, it’s a deadly serious drama; but to the player the wordplay and overdrawn metaphors provide an additional layer of enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these graphic novels gives the game’s backstory. As a young, successful New York detective with a beautiful wife and a baby daughter, Max is living the American dream. You already know what’s coming next: One fateful evening, Max returns home to find his wife and child dead, murdered by junkies high on a new drug, Valkyr. Max inevitably turns to single-minded pursuit of whoever is responsible, joining the DEA to track down the source of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4622005939/" title="Bodies by adurdin, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4622005939_0090573f0b.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="Bodies"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valkyr seems to cause severe mental health issues, and prolonged use leads to psychosis, paranoia, and extreme violence. At one point in the story, Max himself is forcibly injected with the drug. Under its influence, Max dreams, and his dreams are nightmares, all his existential doubts brought to the fore. He fears that he’s not, after all, in control: that he’s just a pawn in someone else’s game—even someone else’s videogame. &lt;i&gt;“Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the drug has taken Max out of his grimy reality into hallucinations, the game can finally break its straight face, and openly share a joke with the player. The greatest fear of the fictional character—brought to life only in the player’s imaginations, and imbued only with the traits written for him—is that he might be, after all, fictional. This realisation horrifies Max; but to the player the irony brings a light-hearted chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the game’s plot develops, its threads are not unexpected, indeed many are cliché: Max being framed for his DEA partner’s death; a failed government super-soldier research programme; a powerful secret society; and corporate greed. If any of these were dwelt on too long, they might well break the player’s immersion. But the momentum of Max’s revenge drives the story on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s this momentum which makes the story work. The different elements of the writing are combined together effectively into a flavoursome whole. Like a good hamburger, Max Payne’s story is an mix of appetising layers on a bed of just enough meat—and garnished with a slice of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

Initially seen as a mark of the device’s simplicity of design and focus on the touch screen, in subsequent iPhone OS releases, the home button has had more and more functions grafted onto it—some of them not even constant but contextual—until I wonder why Apple just didn’t add another few buttons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A single press will take you back to the home screen.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A press and hold activates VoiceOver on the 3GS and later devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So simple.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="523137224" url="https://backslashn.com/post/523137224" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/523137224/observations-on-lua-and-the-iphone-developer" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-04-15 11:51:00 GMT" date="Thu, 15 Apr 2010 12:51:00" unix-timestamp="1271332260" format="markdown" reblog-key="uTXzp6oN" slug="observations-on-lua-and-the-iphone-developer" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Observations on Lua and the iPhone Developer Agreement</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Some observations on &lt;a href="http://blog.anscamobile.com/2010/04/lua-the-lingua-franca-of-iphone-games/"&gt;the use of Lua in iPhone games&lt;/a&gt;, and sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 of the iPhone Developer Agreement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of (non cross-compiled) Lua has not been allowed by the terms of section 3.3.2 of the Developer Agreement &lt;a href="http://uikit.com/interpret"&gt;since March last year&lt;/a&gt;. Developers have continued to use it regardless, probably not even noticing the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple doesn’t come close to enforcing the terms of the agreement consistently. If you use Lua or other scripting languages, this is good, as you don’t need to worry too much about it. And it’s bad, because that gives them ample reason to pull all your apps with zero notice should you do something that offends Apple—or if your use of it was merely overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lua has been used for more than a decade for game scripting: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango"&gt;Grim Fandango&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1998, was one of the first commercial games to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games have been using interpreted scripting languages for game logic for more than a decade before that. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion"&gt;Maniac Mansion&lt;/a&gt; was released in 1987, and used the SCUMM language developed in-house at Lucasarts for most game logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first-generation iPhone is immensely more powerful than any computer available in 1987. It&amp;rsquo;s also significantly more powerful than the computer I had in 1998, save in screen size. Scripting languages can work well on very low-performance devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One popular argument in support of the new section 3.3.1 is that it provides a minimum barrier to entry that will uphold the quality of apps in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots—tens to hundreds of thousands—of shit quality apps in the App Store, written solely with C, C++, and Objective-C. The use of these languages in no way promotes quality. (I would argue the opposite: that a less-experienced developer is more likely to write a poorly engineered app in one of these than in a higher-level language).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The counterpoint to 3.3.1 (and indeed 3.3.2) which has not—as far as I’m aware—been widely stated is this: if enforced, it will increase the cost of development for iPhone OS. C, C++, and Objective-C are much more expensive to develop with for complex applications (games particularly). Most paid iPhone apps sell for 99c. I think you can draw your own conclusions as to likely knock-on effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edit: &lt;a href="http://nevali.net/"&gt;nevali&lt;/a&gt; points out that the game Zork was also largely written in a scripting language—and in 1979.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="521460838" url="https://backslashn.com/post/521460838" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/521460838/natterings-fluid-as-xcode-documentation-viewer" type="link" date-gmt="2010-04-14 20:07:00 GMT" date="Wed, 14 Apr 2010 21:07:00" unix-timestamp="1271275620" format="markdown" reblog-key="ZYFXinS3" slug="natterings-fluid-as-xcode-documentation-viewer" state="published" is_reblog="true" tumblelog="backslashn"><link-text>Natterings: Fluid as Xcode Documentation Viewer</link-text><link-url>http://blog.nuthatch.com/post/308345475/fluid-as-xcode-documentation-viewer</link-url><link-description>&lt;p&gt;This is almost exactly what I was looking for in a standalone documentation viewer for Cocoa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standalone Documentation Viewer for Xcode with &lt;b&gt;tabs&lt;/b&gt;, bitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that what Stephen writes about modifying the page titles is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now using &lt;a href="http://fluidapp.com/"&gt;Fluid&lt;/a&gt; to view all the reference docs on my second monitor. And unlike Xcode&amp;rsquo;s documentation viewer, I can ⌘Tab directly to it, and all its windows behave like normal windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two downsides: the first is that there&amp;rsquo;s no search—although being able to filter the documents keeps it pretty quick to jump to, say the UIBezierPath reference.  The second downside is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tie into Xcode’s option-click; but that affects me less, as I very rarely use the mouse within the editor anyway—I’m a keyboard guy.&lt;/p&gt;</link-description></post><post id="518923883" url="https://backslashn.com/post/518923883" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/518923883/in-which-i-complain-again" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-04-13 20:06:00 GMT" date="Tue, 13 Apr 2010 21:06:00" unix-timestamp="1271189160" format="markdown" reblog-key="frfQlyO4" slug="in-which-i-complain-again" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>In which I complain (again?!)</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/420370426"&gt;Marco writes:—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before Instapaper Pro 2.2, I got frequent emails from customers who were upset that they had inadvertently tapped the status bar, which scrolls to the top of the article and loses their position. I understood completely, since losing your read position is a form of minor data loss.
  Most of them were unaware that this is a systemwide gesture on the iPhone OS: if you tap the status bar in any screen that contains a table view or web view, it scrolls to the top. It’s quite useful if you know about it and expect it, but alarming — and, in Instapaper’s case, destructive — if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, today I decided enough was enough. The thirty-third time time I intentionally tapped the status bar to scroll back to the top of an article I was reading in Instapaper Pro (which has otherwise superceded sliced bread), I cracked. Maybe it was related to the fact that &lt;a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/09/stop-telling-me-what-to-do/"&gt;the blogpost I was reading&lt;/a&gt; was about &lt;i&gt;machines that tell us, annoyingly, what to do&lt;/i&gt; (well, more or less). And I scroll up to the top of the article as a kind of reflex, I re-read the title and maybe the opening paragraph as I reflect on the piece, and decide whether to skim back to the good bits and blog or tweet them or just archive it. Pretty much always I decide to archive it, and then there’s this stupid button there! It says “Cancel”. Cancel what? Or “Return to position” — I was at the bottom of the article? Why would I particularly want to go back there so soon after intentionally scrolling to the top?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a time when an annoying man kept telling me to do something. Something obvious, that I clearly already knew, like that my taxes were overdue or something. Definitely something vaguely if at all related to the point of my post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using computers basically since I was born thirty years ago. I think that’s about enough time to consider that when I do something, pretty much I choose to do it. I’ve grown past the stage of pressing random buttons just to see what happens, or to hear the funny sounds, or see the screen light up in that beautiful blue shade. I’ve been using an iPhone for nearly three years, almost one tenth of that time. Did you know that by the time a child is three years old, they can walk on their own without falling over all the time? And they can talk and actually make sense (maybe even more than this post)? Pretty much by that time they’ve worked out the whole intentional vs. accidental thing. I’m pretty sure that I’m not the only person that keeps running into this problem of something needlessly in the way of what I actually want to do (am I really the only one? (so lonely)). Maybe now that I’ve brought it up, you’ll find you cannot unsee it (that, my friends is a &lt;i&gt;very dangerous&lt;/i&gt; pair of words to put into google image search (yes, I’ve tried it (although one of the images was of the &lt;a href="http://mightypenguin66.tumblr.com/post/319999808"&gt;tumblr logo&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty much SFW, at least in my workplace)). I suppose unsee isn&amp;rsquo;t the right word, more un-not-have-it-pop-up-in-the-way, but that’s more awkward to write.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="510239009" url="https://backslashn.com/post/510239009" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/510239009/resolution" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-04-10 08:22:16 GMT" date="Sat, 10 Apr 2010 09:22:16" unix-timestamp="1270887736" format="markdown" reblog-key="YR1pvaHW" slug="resolution" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Resolution</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://resolution-magazine.co.uk/"&gt;Resolution Magazine&lt;/a&gt; is a small online games magazine. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for almost two years now, and although I’ve only been reading it for a little less than one, it has become my second–favourite place to read about games&lt;super&gt;[1]&lt;/super&gt;.  Not to get the latest news or gossip, since the magazine purposefully avoids regurgitating headlines endlessly—but to read reviews, opinions, and commentary on games and gaming. Lewis Denby, its creator and editor, writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’ve always hoped we filled a gap in the market rather than simply adding yet another fan-run games tabloid to the roster. We wanted to create something in the online space that did what the magazines we’d grown up reading did: to provide a healthy mix of standard games coverage – news, reviews, previews – with fiercely opinionated editorials and in-depth, researched features – all presented neatly, and with just the right balance of silly humour and take-me-seriously-seriousness.”&lt;super&gt;[2]&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, so far I think he’s doing a bang-up job of it.  Despite running almost entirely out of Lewis’s own pocket—the site is not yet breaking even—he’s managed to attract several talented young writers to contribute regularly to the magazine, and the site presents a clean, professional appearance that lets you get straight into the important bit: reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Lewis and his deputy editor Daniel Lipscombe should be immensely proud of what they’ve got here—but there’s no chance of them resting on their laurels yet.  Last week, Lewis wrote a long, frank &lt;a href="http://lewisdenby.wordpress.com/2010/04/03/a-new-years-resolution/"&gt;post on his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, covering the history of the magazine so far, his struggle to make it financially sustainable, and his questions to his audience about its direction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So here’s where I come to you: what do you want out of Resolution Magazine? Do you read it regularly? If so, why? If not, what’s stopping you? If you were in charge, what would your vision be? What do you think’s missing from the enthusiast gaming press?”&lt;super&gt;[2]&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, all I can think is that I want to see Resolution do keep on doing what it’s done so far. I’d have written this post earlier, but I was having difficulty expressing what I want to get from the magazine.  As it happened, someone else—writing not about game news specifically, but news in general—summed it up for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I want last week’s news, but only what I need to know, and only if it has proven to have relevance beyond the day it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Tell me an overview of what happened in a given field, like technology, but with the hindsight of a week to sleep on it and evaluate what really matters. The delay also provides more time for investigation and analysis to reduce blind speculation, promote thoughtful writing, and encourage big-picture perspective.” — &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/502016907"&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A site following these guidelines won’t appeal to the “news junkie”, but I’m quite sure there’s a viable readership out there: avid gamers like me who, being no longer carefree students don’t have the patience to winnow the chaff of the noisy, attention–seeking gaming news sites; but who want something more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, as soon as Lewis switches on the paid subscription option, I’m signing up. I think this site has something great that’s worth paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to add your own bits to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a view that was performing abysmally with some data sets, so I decided I needed to profile it.  With a few minutes work, I was able to put together a really simple plugin for the toolbar, that uses Python’s “hotshot” profiler.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of it in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4502063191/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/4502063191_6374a97e15_b.jpg" width="1024" height="193" alt="Profiling" style="margin:0 -150px"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s the code. Stick this on your PYTHONPATH in &lt;code&gt;debug_profiling.py&lt;/code&gt;, and add &lt;code&gt;'debug_profiling.ProfilingPanel',&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS&lt;/code&gt; setting.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a great game, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it.  But there&amp;rsquo;s this one level that made me feel very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the gunner in an AC-130 gunship, slowly circling an area to support a friendly squad moving through to an evacuation point.  My only view was through the infrared gunsight of a cannon, shooting back at the numerous enemies that were shooting at the friendlies.  Not really shooting back though: the gunship was way out of range of the enemy infantry, and its cannon was powerful enough to blow them through the air.  It was like crushing ants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4497764301/" title="Oopsie-daisy."&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4497764301_c696f9e8fb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Oopsie-daisy."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made it more unsettling that the crew of the gunship would say sardonically, “Ooo, that’s gotta hurt”, or “Oopsie-daisy” after each kill. Despite feeling a bit odd about it, I did finish the level, and went on to enjoy the rest of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now uninstalling it, and throwing out the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Wikileaks posted &lt;a href="http://collateralmurder.org/"&gt;a video, leaked from the U.S. military,&lt;/a&gt; of an AH-64 Apache attack in 2007, in Baghdad. The helicopter attacked and killed a group of 8 or 9 men, mostly unarmed, including two Reuters employees, journalist and his driver, and injuring two children.  You can see the whole video at that link, but it is not pleasant watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to argue about the legality or morality of war, or the act in the video here.  But while watching it I felt sick hearing the comments the pilot or gunner made during the attack: &lt;em&gt;All right, haha, I got ’em!&lt;/em&gt;  And when one man, severely wounded, was trying to crawl away—they were wishing him to give them a reason to shoot again: &lt;em&gt;Come on, buddy. All you gotta do is pick up a weapon.&lt;/em&gt;  And just a little later, a van pulled up, and three unarmed men began to help the wounded man in, the gunner asked for permission to engage, and said cajoling, &lt;em&gt;Come on, let us shoot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was strongly reminded while watching of the gunship sequence in Call of Duty 4. I  had to keep reminding myself that this video was not just a game, this was real people being really killed.  I had excused the sequence in the game by thinking it was exaggerated, a Hollywood-like view.  But having seen the exact same thing &lt;em&gt;actually happening&lt;/em&gt; in reality, well… I don’t think I want to play that game anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary.&lt;/strong&gt; At a glance, you can see all the available tabs, and scan their labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatiality.&lt;/strong&gt; Each tab is always in the same place, so you know where to find it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience.&lt;/strong&gt; Activating another tab takes a single click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context.&lt;/strong&gt; The active tab is displayed more prominently, so you know where you are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But—like most other UI elements, but quicker—tabs become unmanageable as their number increases. Try a little experiment in your favourite browser: open 10 different pages in tabs; now another 10; how about 50 tabs altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 4 or 5 tabs, most applications begin to reduce the tab size to fit more of them on the screen. And after a few more tabs are opened, the application will hide some of the tabs.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how three popular browsers behave, with a window 1000 pixels wide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4482682010/" title="Safari too many tabs 1 by adurdin, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4482682010_bcdcf9d5ac_o.png" width="1078" height="100" alt="Safari hides the extra tabs in a popup menu" style="margin-left: -200px; margin-right: -200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safari&lt;/strong&gt; hides the extra tabs in a popup menu, accessed by clicking the chevron on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4482645296/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4482645296_87f1123da2_o.png" width="720" height="400" alt="The popup menu shows all the tabs"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popup menu shows all the tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4482033049/" title="Firefox tabs scrolling 1 by adurdin, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2759/4482033049_d0f4b0f712_o.png" width="1078" height="111" alt="Firefox allows the whole tab bar to scroll horizontally" style="margin-left: -200px; margin-right: -200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt; allows the whole tab bar to scroll horizontally, either with a mouse wheel or with scroll arrows at either end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4482644902/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2732/4482644902_259b29e69f_o.png" width="1078" height="111" alt="The tab bar scrolled to the right" style="margin-left: -200px; margin-right: -200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the tab bar scrolled to the right, and the active tab is no longer visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4481995517/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4481995517_2aae85f142_o.png" width="1078" height="97" alt="Chrome continues to shrink its tabs" style="margin-left: -200px; margin-right: -200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; never alters its behaviour, but continues to shrink its tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4482644826/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4036/4482644826_08d0892338_o.png" width="1078" height="97" alt="Tabs shrunk to the point of absurdity" style="margin-left: -200px; margin-right: -200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even continues to do that to the point of absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these solutions compromises at least one of the core benefits of tabs.  Chrome retains usable tabs the longest, although not far beyond 15 tabs the labels are truncated enough that &lt;em&gt;summary&lt;/em&gt; is severely impaired.  Safari loses some of each benefit—but only temporally: the menu preserves &lt;em&gt;summary&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;spatiality&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;, although it must be opened.  Firefox takes quite an odd approach that loses both &lt;em&gt;summary&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;convenience&lt;/em&gt;, while preserving &lt;em&gt;spatiality&lt;/em&gt;.  But it’s the least usable solution: manipulating the scroll arrows is tedious and clumsy; even using a scroll wheel is quite slow. And it’s unituitive that a vertically-oriented scroll wheel should cause horizontal scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of theses are quite so awkward as this gem from the early days of tabbed interfaces—where the rows would exchange places to keep the active tab on the bottom, horribly compromising spatiality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4482760018/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2713/4482760018_ca4b71f11d_o.png" width="420" height="467" alt="Early Microsoft Word options dialog"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, anyway. Given the awkwardness of the scrolling tabs in Firefox, I was initially surprised to see that Apple implemented horizontally scrolling tabs in Keynote on the iPad. However, with the directness of touch input and the ease of flick-scrolling on iPhoneOS, it appears that this interface becomes convenient once again.&lt;/p&gt;

While he also has issues with the puzzle design and storyline of the game, he raises a point that highlighted for me the importance of designing the user interaction of an application to suit the control scheme available to the user. Jason writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a point and click adventure game, The Secret of Monkey Island doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that well in regards to the Xbox 360 controller. You&amp;rsquo;ll use the left thumbstick to act as a mouse point while the A-button moves you around when you click it. The A-button and B-button also act as mouse clicks, which allow you to do certain actions in the game, while the right bumper brings up your inventory list. Clicking an object to interact with and being given a list of drop down options would&amp;rsquo;ve been a much better solution, but instead you either have to manually slog your way through a menu system, or either remember what direction of the D-pad corresponds with what action in the game and work through that way; either way you go it&amp;rsquo;s cumbersome and difficult to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game was originally designed for use with a mouse: along the bottom of the screen was a list of verbs. To interact with an character or object in the game, you would click on the appropriate—or inappropriate—verb, then click on the character or object. And to identify what objects are available to interact with in any given scene, you &lt;em&gt;browse&lt;/em&gt; the screen with your mouse, passing the pointer over the scene, and a small status line displays the name of the object as you hover over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/4476270168/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4476270168_2b5e8ca385.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="The Secret of Monkey Island"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very mouse-centric design. Moving the mouse directly translates to moving the mouse pointer, so this browsing behaviour is effortless. Not so on the Xbox 360 — you still control a mouse pointer, but with an analog stick, a joystick. The position of the stick controls the direction and speed of the mouse pointer, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried this, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand just how awkward that can be. You have to aim from the pointer&amp;rsquo;s current position to the object you want to point at, estimate the speed needed to cover the distance quickly, then push the stick with corresponding force in a particular direction. It’s like playing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)"&gt;Scorched Earth&lt;/a&gt; just to point to something. Of course, with practice this indirect pointing becomes easier, but it is still less precise than the direct control of a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Xbox 360 port doesn’t feature the worst controls; I think the iPhone port wins that prize. It’s rather ironic that—on a device that removes even the slight indirection of a mouse by letting you directly touch the screen—the game retains a virtual mouse pointer and &lt;em&gt;adds&lt;/em&gt; another level of indirection to controlling it. In the iPhone version, the screen is treated as a virtual trackpad: you drag your finger across the screen to move the mouse pointer. And because there’s some acceleration curves involved, the cursor may move slower or faster than your finger. There’s some justification for this design decision; as described above, the game uses a hover interaction to identify the objects in the scene, and a touchscreen just doesn’t do hovering. Again, the presence of hovering as a key behaviour highlights just how fundamental the mouse is to the overall user interaction design of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these interfaces could be bettered, by tailoring the interaction to the strengths and weaknesses of the controller. In the iPhone port of &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/beneath-steel-sky-remastered/id331733638?mt=8"&gt;Beneath a Steel Sky&lt;/a&gt;, you tap directly on an object in the scene to interact with it, a radial menu of icons appearing around it. And recent adventure games on the Xbox, including the fourth sequel &lt;a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/monkeyisland"&gt;Tales of Monkey Island&lt;/a&gt; allow the player to walk the character around the screen with the analog stick, something the analog stick excels at. But Tales of Monkey Island ends up making the same mistake in the other direction: the player of the PC version has to fight with an interface designed for an analog stick, and only crudely adapted to a mouse—despite Telltale Games’s earlier adventure games utilising a natural point-and-click interface in the same game engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re designing an application or game—especially one that will run on multiple platforms—you need to properly design for the control scheme that will be used. &lt;em&gt;A mouse is not the same as an analog stick, nor are either the same as touch input.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave you to consider how horrible it would be to play &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spider-the-secret-bryce-manor/id325954996?mt=8"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt; by clicking+dragging with a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="402924544" url="https://backslashn.com/post/402924544" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/402924544/stalker-call-of-pripyat" type="regular" date-gmt="2010-02-21 17:20:00 GMT" date="Sun, 21 Feb 2010 17:20:00" unix-timestamp="1266772800" format="markdown" reblog-key="pZH5Y8n4" slug="stalker-call-of-pripyat" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Stalker: Call of Pripyat</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;The night is dark, so that I can barely see where I am walking. A line of bushes stands in my way; I make a long detour around them, rather than risk making noise by pushing through. Packs of blinddogs roam this area, preying on the mutant pigs, flesh, but they are always hungry and are not afraid to attack lone Stalkers. And I can hear them howling not far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the distance ahead, a flash lights up the sky. At first I take it to be lightning, for the weather here in the Zone changes rapidly, and it rains and thunders as often as it is clear. Then a voice calls out on the radio: “Attention, attention. An emission is approaching. Seek shelter at once!” Another flash appears, and then more flashes. Emissions seem to occur daily here, massive outbursts of radiation that sweep across the land: no-one has ever survived being outside, unsheltered, during an emission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start to run. Emissions come on awfully quickly, so I have only a few minutes to find shelter. As I reach the crest of a small rise, I can just see ahead the outline of a building, a long-abandoned petrol station; I hope it’ll provide enough cover for me to survive. When I get closer I can make out other shapes moving around the building; it looks like a pack of blinddogs are there, and I fear I can see the glinting eyes of a pseudodog there also. Well, I can’t stay out here. There’s nothing for it, I pull out my shotgun and approach. They smell me coming within seconds, and they attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five dogs, six including the big pseudodog. I unload a few shots at them, and one falls. The remaining dogs don’t rush straight towards me, they split up to approach me from either side. Which is lucky for me, as it leaves the way ahead open. I sprint for the building and duck through the open doorway—now at least there’s a bottleneck where my shotgun gives me an advantage. The sky is suddenly illuminated with an ominous bluish glow—the emission is almost here—but at least I can now see clearly. Three of the dogs are close on my heels, and come through the doorway within seconds. I move frantically around the room, shooting at the dogs, and desperately avoiding their jaws and claws. In this enclosed space, they fall quickly to the shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I move to cover the doorway again, reloading my shotgun as I look out the windows to try and locate the remaining dogs. Too late I hear a noise behind me, as the remaining blinddog and the pseudodog enter the room; they must have come in another way. The pseudodog leaps, throwing me back, and biting me deeply on the leg. I stagger aside, and unload my shotgun into it, killing it. I have no time to reload as the remaining dog approaches, so I draw my knife and slash at it as it leaps. It yelps as the knife connects, then runs hurriedly out the door and into the distance, no longer so keen on a Stalker meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is almost no time left. The glow in the sky is deepening, and the rumbling of the electric flashes is almost constant. I bandage the dog bite as I realise that the openness of the building I’m in isn’t going to give me protection from the emission. I limp out the back door, looking for shelter more substantial. And right there is a sinkhole in the ground, at least fifteen metres deep, probably opening onto caves. It doesn’t look welcoming, but I have no choice. Half-clambering, half-falling, I make my way down inside, reaching the bottom just as the sky turns blood-red and the emission hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crouch in the pitch black at the bottom of the rift, and look up at the sky through the narrow crack above—fortunately too narrow to admit significant radiation. The red glow pulsates to bright white, and the ground shakes. It feels like the world is tearing itself apart. A prolonged thunder fills the air, and builds to a crescendo—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—and then the emission is past. I have survived. The glow fades, the rumble dies down, and I am alone in darkness at the bottom of a pit I can’t climb up. No, not alone: from within the cave opening I can hear growling, and I realise I haven’t survived yet.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>games</tag><tag>stalker</tag><tag>call of pripyat</tag></post><post id="293664248" url="https://backslashn.com/post/293664248" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/293664248/css3-brings-christmas-cheer" type="regular" date-gmt="2009-12-21 18:40:00 GMT" date="Mon, 21 Dec 2009 18:40:00" unix-timestamp="1261420800" format="markdown" reblog-key="Q3YcEHU7" slug="css3-brings-christmas-cheer" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>CSS3 brings Christmas cheer</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;I suddenly realised today that I had never played around with some of the more exciting CSS3 features: masks, keyframe animation, and transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

Funnu, engagin, but most of all: taught you a skill, then made you use it in a different way &amp;ndash; a twist
Portal: using portals, twisting the way you think. Hole in the ceiling to come out the floor.
This is the key to puzzles, why puzzles are entertaining. It&amp;rsquo;s not about thinking outside the box,
it&amp;rsquo;s about training in a skill, then adapting that skill to a new problem: analysis and problem solving.
Intellectual skills that exercise the brain,something innately enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect puzzle has two requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;it must be fun to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it must come with a twist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;quotes from &lt;a href="http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/515/"&gt;http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/interviews/515/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q “We&amp;rsquo;ll blame them than if that ever happens. So some other Monkey Island conventions&amp;hellip; Is insult swordfighting going to be back?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “Not exactly. But there&amp;rsquo;s stuff that is in the vein of insult swordfighting. There are references to insult swordfighting. It&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge. Can it be good enough to be good by itself? Can it be good enough to where if you never played a Monkey Island game you&amp;rsquo;ll think it&amp;rsquo;s awesome? That&amp;rsquo;s one side. And then if that&amp;rsquo;s true, can it also be so good that lives up to the old stuff for the old fans? It&amp;rsquo;s a real challenge. All the callbacks in general are like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™!&amp;rdquo; It worked in text, and as you start to hear it, I start to joke about it, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Guybrush Threepwood!&amp;rdquo; And it&amp;rsquo;s like even I&amp;rsquo;m getting sick of hearing it when Guybrush says to himself, &amp;ldquo;Oh, god!&amp;rdquo; Those callbacks are interesting on how to balance. There are mechanical things like insult swordfighting that are piratey, and you&amp;rsquo;re in the world aggregating abilities like, &amp;ldquo;Ok, I can learn how to do this, learn how to do this from over here.&amp;rdquo; You&amp;rsquo;re kind of grinding for that agency the way you do in insult swordfighting, and there&amp;rsquo;s references to it. But right now, as is planned, we&amp;rsquo;re not going to be doing insult swordfighting exactly like you did in Monkey Island 1. But I think if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of insult swordfighting and you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for it, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be satisfied in both the experience and the references.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q “For me, my favorite part of it was not so much the grinding to collect all your insults and comebacks, but the part where you&amp;rsquo;ve learned all the comebacks, and then you get thrown a new set of insults and you&amp;rsquo;ve got to rematch them, like the sword master and the battles there. Do you have that same kind of creativity applied?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “Just conventionally, that&amp;rsquo;s what I like to do all the way through. It&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to use this in a clever way, now you have used it in a totally opposite way. Wallace and Gromit episode 3 does that, where it&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;This dog digs, this dog steals things. Get them to subvert their powers. And now, an act and a half later, use their powers in a totally different way with the things I&amp;rsquo;ve presented you.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s just good design, that&amp;rsquo;s why insult swordfighting is not just something you remember as being funny but good design.”&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="187888221" url="https://backslashn.com/post/187888221" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/187888221/unfit-for-purposefollowup" type="regular" date-gmt="2009-09-14 19:28:00 GMT" date="Mon, 14 Sep 2009 20:28:00" unix-timestamp="1252956480" format="markdown" reblog-key="OjtJqrKI" slug="unfit-for-purposefollowup" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Unfit for purpose—followup</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;Just a few notes to follow up to my previous &lt;a href="http://backslashn.com/post/185428516/unfit-for-purpose"&gt;post about Apress PDF troubles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my first tweet about the problem, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Apress/status/3913547556"&gt;Apress got back to me&lt;/a&gt; very quickly suggesting  the &lt;a href="http://www.ajidev.com/reader/index.html"&gt;Aji Reader&lt;/a&gt; app that can process password-protected PDFs.  And even followed up later, letting me know that Aji Reader prompting me for the password multiple times was &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Apress/status/3929873633"&gt;a known bug&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, thanks to the lack of Wifi on the train, and the extremely patchy mobile network access, I didn’t see Apress’s original tweet until after I had blogged about the problem. So I want to thank Apress’s customer support for being so active in helping me with my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still makes no sense to have the password on the PDF. The fact that I can’t re-save the password even when knowing it brings this into the realm of DRM, something I feel quite strongly about. I have bought PDFs from the Pragmatic Programmers before, who &lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks/pdfs-how-to"&gt;use no passwords or saving/printing restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, but do put the purchaser’s name and email address in the footer of every page. This is still very much preferable to Apress’s current solution. Better yet, the Pragmatic Programmers offer iPhone-optimised versions of many of their books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest complaint about the whole situation is that Apress make no mention of the DRM on their PDF on the catalogue pages or the checkout page—but only notifies you &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve paid for it. I think they should have a more obvious notice about it. I have just now found their “&lt;a href="http://www.apress.com/info/faq"&gt;eBookshop FAQ&lt;/a&gt;” page, which states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We rely on PDF&amp;rsquo;s password encryption to protect our eBooks from digital piracy. Until a better approach comes up, the eBook will require a password to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Apress, there is a better approach: see the second paragraph above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve been unable to remove the password protection. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Cgodefroy/status/3912906501"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/tarasis/status/3913489468"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/uninen/status/3914565766"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; opening it in Preview and using the “Print-&amp;gt;Save as PDF” option (thanks, guys!), but that no longer works in Snow Leopard. The other suggested solution, the plain old “File-&amp;gt;Save As” just produced another password-protected copy. At this point, I ran out of time, and had to leave for the train station. I tried again after returning back home last night with a third-party app, but it refused to run under Snow Leopard either. I’ve still got a Mac Mini running Tiger or Leopard, so I’ll try with Preview on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in my last post, I said “I’m not going to buy another PDF from Apress unless they start selling unprotected PDFs”. That’s a little ambiguous about my intention: I’m not calling for a boycott, but rather don’t feel it worthwhile spending money on inconvenient ebooks, since convenience is the primary reason for ebooks in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="185428516" url="https://backslashn.com/post/185428516" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/185428516/unfit-for-purpose" type="regular" date-gmt="2009-09-11 17:06:48 GMT" date="Fri, 11 Sep 2009 18:06:48" unix-timestamp="1252688808" format="markdown" reblog-key="2ocJVpUM" slug="unfit-for-purpose" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Unfit for purpose</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;I had another run-in with the paranoid attitude of publishers today. I decided to buy the PDF version of Apress’s &lt;a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430219688"&gt;“iPhone Games Projects”&lt;/a&gt;, which—despite the clumsy title—looked like it might be handy. I&amp;rsquo;d flipped through a friend&amp;rsquo;s hardcopy edition a bit before: each chapter is by a different author, and on a different topic: networking, OpenGL, cross-platform game coding, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m away for the weekend, and will have my iPhone, but not my laptop, so I was hoping to read some of the book on the phone over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PDF was password protected, so that you can&amp;rsquo;t read it without the password; which was not made clear during the purchase process until after I&amp;rsquo;d paid. This effectively renders it useless to me, since my iPhone won&amp;rsquo;t display password-protected PDFs. Since the book does not contain any state secrets that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of, the only reason to have the password is to make the PDF harder to share online, at the expense of (at best) inconveniencing the purchaser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back home, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find an app to strip the password protection away; but until then, I&amp;rsquo;m left once again with a product that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as advertised, due entirely to the publisher’s paranoid and vain attempts to stop the illicit spread of the PDF. And the irony is, as always, that I could have downloaded the PDF illicitly, and got a more usable product at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m not going to buy another PDF from Apress unless they start selling unprotected PDFs. I might go look at the Pragmatic Programmer’s catalog now, since I’ve heard they sell real, usable PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="183069105" url="https://backslashn.com/post/183069105" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/183069105/how-to-sell-to-a-pirate" type="regular" date-gmt="2009-09-08 20:40:34 GMT" date="Tue, 08 Sep 2009 21:40:34" unix-timestamp="1252442434" format="markdown" reblog-key="LAHNLF6L" slug="how-to-sell-to-a-pirate" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>How to sell to a pirate</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://po-ru.com/diary/how-to-sell-to-a-pirate/"&gt;Paul Battley&lt;/a&gt;, to the media industries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no point in putting restrictions on the sale of the legal copy, because your free competitor &lt;em&gt;has the same product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you region-code the product, &lt;em&gt;you prevent me from buying it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you don’t sell the product in my territory, &lt;em&gt;you prevent me from buying it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you put DRM on the product, you prevent me from using it on the device of my choice. I don’t want to be locked into buying Apple products forever, for example. And that &lt;em&gt;prevents me from buying it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no point in putting DRM or other restrictions on the product, because &lt;em&gt;it’s already available.&lt;/em&gt; Give me commonly-accepted formats in a choice of bitrates. What’s the worst that can happen? I upload it to Usenet? It’s already there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also makes the point that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even though it’s free, pirating stuff is still a bit of a hassle. You [the media industry] could definitely beat them [the pirates] on convenience and speed of release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you know what? The media industry had better get its act together quickly: the options for piracy are only getting simpler and easier.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post><post id="180367539" url="https://backslashn.com/post/180367539" url-with-slug="https://backslashn.com/post/180367539/ramp-champ-revamp" type="regular" date-gmt="2009-09-05 13:04:22 GMT" date="Sat, 05 Sep 2009 14:04:22" unix-timestamp="1252155862" format="markdown" reblog-key="NBdCmfa8" slug="ramp-champ-revamp" state="published" is_reblog="false" tumblelog="backslashn"><regular-title>Ramp Champ Revamp?</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;After noticing quite a few people on Twitter talking about &lt;a href="http://rampchamp.com/"&gt;Ramp Champ&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to give it a go.  The artists from The Iconfactory have done an amazing job on the graphics for this little game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time you start the game, and tap on a ramp to begin playing, it opens with a brief tutorial made of of five short messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/3889741640/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2435/3889741640_28d2a0527c_m_d.jpg" alt="Flick up on the ramp to roll the ball."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/3888948509/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2653/3888948509_01a8e6e9df_m.jpg" alt="You get 9 balls for each round."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/3889741854/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2422/3889741854_f6fe0dbb87_m.jpg" alt="Your score! 500 pts = 1 Ticket."/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/3889741958/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3439/3889741958_dec7049e57_m.jpg" alt="Ramp goals are here. Win trophies and bonus tickets!"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adurdin/3889742064/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/3889742064_63de187011_m.jpg" alt="Done with this ramp? Turn in your tickets for fabulous prizes! [Play again button] [Done button]"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final message thoroughly confused me: the game was asking me if I was done and would like to turn in my tickets—but I hadn’t yet begun playing, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t got any tickets yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only two buttons to choose from, I thought that “Done” would take me back to the menu; so, thinking that I had run into an odd bug where the game was wrongly showing the end-of-level menu, I chose “Play Again”, thinking that would allow me to start playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it didn’t: it replayed the tutorial. Suddenly the final tutorial message made sense: it was showing me how to get back to the main menu so I’d know when I &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; done with the ramp; and the buttons meant “Play the tutorial again”, and “Done with the tutorial, let me play the game!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could this confusion have been avoided? Perhaps if the screen had been labelled like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you’re done,&lt;br/&gt;
  turn in your tickets&lt;br/&gt;
  for fabulous prizes!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;[Show me again]&lt;br/&gt;
  [Play the game]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now I noticed a second, smaller problem with the tutorial: since I had already seen it, and had unintentionally asked to show it again, I did not need to read the messages again. But I couldn’t skip them: it advanced through the tutorial in its own good time, and I tapped on each screen to no avail. First confusion, now frustration, but finally it was over, and I tapped Done to begin playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here a third problem arose. I have an original iPhone, and although it’s not the snappiest beast, it’s capable of playing quite complex games. In ramp Champ it was almost fast enough, almost. The framerate was just the slightest bit erratic. Worse: this affected the controls, and flicking the ball felt unresponsive and hard to control. Just to make sure it wasn’t my lack of skill making it hard for me, I also installed the game on my second-generation iPod Touch, which is noticeably faster than the phone: and here it was fine: I could perhaps aim no better, but now flicks would give an immediate, and consistent response. I was quite surprised that it had such a performance issue, since there are barely more than a dozen elements moving on the screen. I guess there’s room for some more optimisation here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game itself is pleasant: collect tickets by knocking down the various targets, then collect your tickets and trade them in for a variety of beautifully-rendered icons of prizes. But after having played around with it for a while, I don’t think it’s quite my thing.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post></posts></tumblr>
