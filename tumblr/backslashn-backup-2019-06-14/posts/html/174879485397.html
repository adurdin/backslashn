(Available to buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/jalopy">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/jalopy">Humble</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/446020/Jalopy/">Steam</a>).</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t let me put oil into the engine :(</p>

<p>I do like how my character can just walk around casually carrying the engine block though.</p>

<p>This car is a beast! 0 to 60 in just 22.5 seconds!</p>

<p>There are wisps of smoking coming from the bonnet. Should I be worried?</p>

<p>Spent the night at the motel, but now it won&rsquo;t let me start the car? Doesn&rsquo;t say why at all, just beeps at me when I try to :(</p>

<p>Looking at the steam forums to try to find out what I&rsquo;m missing, and wow are there a ton of threads about bugs ðŸ˜§</p>

<p>Right, I&rsquo;d forgotten to select a route on the map.</p>

<p>A bigger problem: for some reason, although I filled up the petrol tank and the jerry can, we ran out of fuel in minutes, <em>and</em> the jerry can is now empty?!?</p>

<p>Also somehow it&rsquo;s night again already? The day lasted like five minutes??</p>

<hr><p><strong>8:48 AM - 12 Jun 2018</strong></p>

<p>Walking back to the petrol stationâ€”which is on the other side of the border.</p>

<p>The guards don&rsquo;t seem to mind me crossing the border on foot though, they just ignore me.</p>

<p>Oops, I forgot the jerry can and my wallet. Back across the border to the car, then all the way back again.</p>

<p>Okay, got some fuel. Made it back to the car, filled it up. Went to add oil to the mix, but whoops: out of oil.</p>

<p>Guess we&rsquo;re driving on straight petrol then! Hope the bearings don&rsquo;t seize up ðŸ™ƒ</p>

<hr><p><strong>9:04 AM - 12 Jun 2018</strong></p>

<p>Found a cardboard box full of medicine just sitting in the middle of a mountain road. How strange.</p>

<p>Taking it with me, cause that stuff&rsquo;s valuable!</p>

<p>Car&rsquo;s rather a mess after driving on these muddy roads!</p>

Don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to be able to drive across there.</p>

<p>Ran out of fuel again, right on the train tracks!</p>

<p>Classic.</p>

<hr><p><strong>9:49 AM - 12 Jun 2018</strong></p>

<p>So&hellip; got to the town, and realised I&rsquo;d bought some stuff way back at the petrol station just by the railway bridge, but had forgotten to collect it.</p>

<p>Rather than drive the car all the way back, wearing it down, and consuming fuel and stuff, I thought I&rsquo;d just walk back.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take very much longer at all. Even though the distance is (according to the road signs) 210 km ðŸ˜‚</p>

<p>Also the days are short, but this night lasts forever.</p>

<p>The time and space compression in this game is really weird.</p>

<p>Okay, back at the car. Found a couple of boxes along the way too, so I had more medicine and wine to sell. Only had to walk 420km, totally worth it!</p>

<hr><p><strong>10:12 AM - 12 Jun 2018</strong></p>

<p>Right. Spent the night in the motel at Sturovo. Now to cross the Hungarian border.</p>

<p>But first, I&rsquo;m going to bed: the 2 hours sleep I got last night is catching up to me.</p>

<p>Anyway: Jalopy is cheap and cheerful. Even though the controls are fiddly, it&rsquo;s not unpleasant to play. Drive around, collect things, buy things, maintain the car.</p>

<p>Biggest complaint is just how fast the car eats through fuel and how fast all its parts degrade.</p>
