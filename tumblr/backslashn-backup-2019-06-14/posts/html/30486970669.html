                    <p>I still had my name and my voice, but I could no longer recognise myself. I&rsquo;d gotten old, fastâ€”a fat, slow washout who cowers behind walls and gets other people killed. I filled the empty spaces between the battles with drink for the memories and pills for the pain, but they only made things worse. Now a vague sense of loyalty was all that kept me on the job. I was still here, but my soul was long dead.</p>
