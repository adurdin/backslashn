                    <p>VVVVVV is a row of jagged spikes that I have just accidentally collided with, killing me and sending me back to the last checkpoint. Slowly my skill at manipulating movement and gravity improves. <em>I can do it this timeâ€¦</em></p>

<p>VVVVVV is the set of teeth that grips me, holding my attention in this unfairest of games. Attempt and failure cycle rapidly and blur the passing of time until I can succeed and move on to the next screen. <em>Dammit, so close!</em></p>

<p>VVVVVV is how you spell the sound I&rsquo;m making, screaming at the top of my voice while my teeth bite down on my lower lip in frustration. I don&rsquo;t even need to complete this section, it&rsquo;s just for an optional collectible! <em>But I can&rsquo;t give up now.</em></p>

<p>VVVVVV is a captivating old-school styled platform game by Terry Cavanagh, that will surprise you both with its economy of ideas and the variety of challenging puzzles built from them. It&rsquo;s available for Windows and Mac, so <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es">why not try the demo</a>? <em>Veni, vidi, vici.</em></p>
