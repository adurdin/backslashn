                    <p>When I had killed as many enemies by kicking with my boot as by shooting, I started to question the name of this game. Its points-for-combos approach to combat and emphasis on using environmental hazards is fresh and exciting, but the story it has to tell follows Epic&rsquo;s trademark bro-gamer recipe, with a sprinkling of comedyâ€”sadly not self-aware enough to be parody. However, I give it points for its lush, colourful (if post-apocalyptic) setting.</p>
